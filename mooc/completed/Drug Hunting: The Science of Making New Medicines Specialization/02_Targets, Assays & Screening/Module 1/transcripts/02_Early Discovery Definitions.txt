By the end of this video, you will be able to define some common terminology associated with assays and screening. This terminology will be helpful for discussions later in this course. Let's start with the kind of assays we will discuss in this course. Assays can be classified in many different ways. One division is a binding assay versus a functional assay. Binding assays measure the degree to which a molecule binds to the target protein. Binding assays may report the Potency as a Kd value. The Kd corresponds to the concentration required to achieve 50% binding. A functional assay measures the action of a molecule beyond its binding. The action could be, for example, gene expression, enzyme inhibition, or ion transport. The potency of a molecule in a functional assay is normally expressed as an EC 50 or IC 50, the concentration required to achieve 50% maximal activity. Another assay division is biochemical versus cellular. Biochemical assays are commonly used for binding assays or simpler functional assays, like enzyme inhibition tests. Cellular assays rely on intact cells and are therefore required for many functional assays. Because cellular assays require cells, they are generally more technically challenging and slower than biochemical assays. Let's now look at four types of screens and assays that are performed early in a discovery campaign. First is the primary screen. The primary screen is often a biochemical or cellular high throughput assay to check libraries of molecules for potential actives. The primary screen checks on a molecule's potency, and depending on the type of assay and endpoint used, may not provide any information on efficacy. Next is a counter screen. Some molecules will show activity in the primary screen, but their activity is from interfering with the assay technology rather than true target binding. For example, an assay that is dependent upon fluorescence may identify fluorescent compounds themselves as hits regardless of whether they interact with the specific target. Counter screens therefore help eliminate false positives in the primary screen. An orthogonal assay measures on target activity of molecules in a manner different from the primary screen. Orthogonal assays therefore provide confirmation for the primary screen. For example, by shifting the assay from a fluorescent based assay to an LCMS based assay to detect activity. One can begin to build confidence that the small molecule hits are acting on the target. Secondary assays tend to be more functional in design. Secondary assays are used on promising molecules to confirm that activity observed in the primary screen is capable of affecting the disease pathway in more biologically complex systems. At the cellular, tissue or organ level. They may also be used to assess other characteristics of the molecule, such as physicochemical properties, safety, and PK. Here are some different types of active molecules discovered through screening, active or primary hit. These are molecules showing appreciable activity in the primary screen. Actives are identified based on activity measured just once at just one concentration level often one or ten micromolar. Confirmed hit, actives that have been tested at multiple concentrations in order to quantify potency as an IC50 or EC50 value. Validated hit, a hit with activity confirmed through one or more orthogonal assays and testing negative in counter screen assays. The chemical identity of these hits is also typically confirmed. Validated hits can be chemical starting points for a discovery program. Lead series, a series of analogues from a common scaffold that shows potential for further improvement in terms of potency efficacy, PK and safety. There are certainly a lot of definitions. These terms provide us with common vocabulary that we can use as we further explore targets, assays and screening.
