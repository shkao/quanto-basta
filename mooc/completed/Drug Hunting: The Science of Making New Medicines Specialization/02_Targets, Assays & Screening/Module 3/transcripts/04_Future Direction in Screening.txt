By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to list some important features of DNA encoded libraries DELs. You will also be able to describe how DELs are used in a high throughput screen. DNA encoded libraries, or DELs, are libraries of molecules that consist of two parts. One part is a small molecule compound. The other part is a segment of DNA. The molecule and DNA are connected into one large structure. This entire structure is the library member. The small molecule determines target binding. The DNA segment is an identifier for the small molecule. DELs, with millions and even over a billion molecules, are becoming more commonplace. Furthermore, the entire library can be stored in a single tube. A remarkably small volume DELs can be prepared relatively easily. How do you use them for screening? The screen starts with the target protein, which has been immobilized to a surface. A library sample, which contains an example of every library member is added to the target protein. Compounds that do not bind the target can be easily washed from the test surface, leaving only the compounds bound to the target protein. Bound compounds can then be separated from the target protein, and then the DNA tag is cleaved from the compound. Sequencing of the DNA tag reveals the identity of the small molecule. In this manner, one can identify which small molecules bind to the target protein. Confirming the hits requires more work, but that is the general outline of the screening process. An area of advancement in chemistry is microfluidics. Microfluidics studies the flow of tiny volumes of liquids through microchannels in a surface. Researchers are actively studying combining microfluidics and DNA encoded libraries. DELs for this purpose are designed differently. The small molecule is connected to a microscopic polymer bead. The DNA tag is also attached to the bead. The beads are combined with all the reagents needed for a fluorescencebased assay forced through a microchannel system and mixed with oil. Each bead with its molecule and DNA tag, forms an aqueous droplet with the assay reagents within the oil medium. The bead reagent droplets are essentially miniature chemical reaction vessels. The oil and droplets pass through a UV light, which separates the molecule from the bead, allowing the molecule to interact with the target protein in the assay medium. Target binding minimizes fluorescence in the droplet. So droplets with low fluorescence presumably have strong target binding by the library compound. Low fluorescence droplets are diverted into a separate reservoir. The DNA tags are then read, and the identity of the active compound is determined. While the technology is still being optimized, the testing of DELs through microfluidic systems could reduce library screening times from weeks to days. Such improvements would greatly assist in the discovery of new chemical starting points for a drug discovery program. On the screen is a short video showing the sorting stage for the droplets. Droplets flow from right to left through a point that is irradiated by a laser and monitored by an electrode. The first droplets weekly interact with the laser, do not trigger the electrode, and pass down the lower channel. These droplets contain compounds that weekly bind to target protein. The next droplets interact strongly with the laser. These are the hits trigger the electrode gate and are diverted along the upper channel, where the DNA tags will be decoded to allow identification of the structure of the hit. This short video demonstrates how the droplets can be rapidly and accurately sorted to identify active compounds. That is, a more detailed description of DNA encoded libraries. The combination of a molecule with an identifying DNA tag enables the creation and screening of much larger compound libraries. DELs may also be amenable to be used with microfluidics to further accelerate the pace of screening.
