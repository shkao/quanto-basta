By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to differentiate phase one and phase two metabolic reactions. You will also be able to list many of the common enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions of drugs. >> Drug metabolism, arises from a defense mechanism of living organisms. Organisms are regularly exposed to toxic substances. Toxic substances are often called xenobiotics, which are substances that are foreign to an organism. Most drugs are also xenobiotics, if an organism consumes a foreign substance, a xenobiotic, then biological pathways. Metabolic pathways chemically break down and modify the substance to make new metabolites, which are usually less toxic and more rapidly excreted. Metabolic pathways greatly impact the fate of a drug. They play a role in drug clearance, and reduce potential drug exposure. Furthermore, new metabolites may show on or off target activity. Therefore, understanding these metabolic pathways and the enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions, is very important.
Metabolic reactions are normally classified into different phases, we will start our discussion with phase one metabolism. Phase one metabolism includes, three types of chemical transformations oxidations, reductions and hydrolysis reactions. All of these reactions are catalyzed by enzymes. The most important enzymes for phase one metabolism, are members of the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These sip enzymes mostly oxidize drugs. There are dozens of sip isoforms, but only a few participate in drug metabolism especially important are the sip 3A enzymes. While mostly found in the liver, sips are also active in other tissues, including the intestinal lining and kidneys. Monoamine oxidases, are another family of enzymes that metabolize some drugs, including multiple agents intended to treat central nervous system disorders. Hydrolytic reactions, are catalyzed by esterases and lipases, often found circulating in the plasma. Phase one reactions vary widely, here are just two representative examples. On the top is the oxidation of phenotoin, an anticonvulsant. The reaction adds an Group to one of the drug's rings, on the bottom is an oxidation of seven ethoxycoumarin. The molecule is often used to probe sip mediated oxidations, the ethyl group is oxidatively cleaved to form an alcohol. Which is easily detected by fluorescence spectroscopy. Phase two reactions are also called conjugations. Phase two reactions involve the addition of a polar group to a drug or metabolite. The additional polar group increases the water solubility of the new metabolite. Often decreases the volume of distribution, and increases the clearance of the metabolite through either the kidneys or the biliary root. Conjugation reactions are catalyzed by enzymes belonging to the transferase superfamily. One common class of conjugation enzyme, is UGT UDP glucrenal transferase, which adds a glucoronic acid group to a drug or metabolite. Here is the glucronyl group, another enzyme class is salt sulfotransferase. These add a sulfur group to form a sulfate, both UGT and salt tend to react on Groups of a drug or metabolite. Glucoidation at nitrogen and sulfur or even carbon atoms is also observed, the resulting metabolite is much more polar. Both of these structures are drawn neutral, but both would be ionized in the plasma and have increased polarity. Here are two phase two conjugations based on our previous phase one reactions, on the top is the phase one metabolite of phenytoin. The Group, undergoes glucoidation to give a new, more polar metabolite. On the bottom, is a phase one metabolite of seven ethoxycoumarin. The Of the metabolite undergoes sulfation, to form a new polar metabolite. In these two examples, the reactive Groups that are handles for phase two conjugation, arose from phase one oxidations. This sequence phase one, then phase two, is common. But many drugs undergo phase two reactions without an phase one functionalization. >> We have now differentiated, between phase one metabolic reactions, oxidations reductions, and hydrolysis from phase two reactions conjugations. We have also listed some of the key enzymes, that are associated with these processes in.
