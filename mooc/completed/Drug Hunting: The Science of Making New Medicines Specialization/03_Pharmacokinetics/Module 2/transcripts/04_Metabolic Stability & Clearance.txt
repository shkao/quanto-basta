By the conclusion of this video, you'll be able to describe metabolic stability assays. You will be able to outline how clearance can be predicted from the results of stability assays. Finally, you'll be able to connect how the metabolic stability of a compound can affect its dose size and frequency. Drug metabolism constitutes one of the most important drug clearance pathways in vivo. As such, newly synthesized drug molecules are screened for their metabolic stability in dedicated biochemical assays to ensure sufficient concentrations of an administered drug can be maintained in vivo to effectively engage the biological target. Drug metabolizing enzymes can be classified as Phase I and Phase II. Phase I enzymes catalyze reactions such as oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis. Whereas Phase II enzymes catalyze conjugation-type reactions. Of all the possible biotransformation that can occur in vivo, hepatic oxidative metabolism catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes constitutes greater than 50% of the metabolic clearance of marketed drugs. In vitro assays to assess metabolic stability of new drug molecules are performed to identify molecules with sufficient stability to progress. In these assays, compounds at a single concentration, usually one micromolar are incubated with liver microsomes and enzyme cofactors, for example, NADPH for cytochrome P450. The rate at which the drug molecule is metabolized is monitored by measuring the loss of parent drug over time to estimate an apparent in vitro microsomal intrinsic drug clearance value. Extrapolating the in vitro apparent microsomal intrinsic clearance to estimate in vivo hepatic clearance requires multiple steps. The units of in vitro apparent clearance are microliters of the incubation cleared of the drug per minute per milligram of microsomal protein. Several scaling factors, which are species-specific account for the amount of microsomal protein used in the stability assay per gram of liver and the weight of liver in grams per kilogram of body weight. Incorporating these scaling factors yields the scaled microsomal intrinsic clearance in units of milliliters per minute per kilogram. Since metabolism requires a delivery of the unbound drug to the liver, the liver blood flow in units of milliliters per minute per kilogram is used to derive the in vivo hepatic clearance value. The value is calculated using the hepatic clearance equation shown to the lower left. Q represents the species-specific blood flow value, F_u is the fraction of the drug that is unbound in the plasma, and CL_int is the scaled microsomal intrinsic clearance value. The hepatic clearance can also be estimated with assays using other liver subcellular fractions or isolated hepatocytes. These assays include not only the Phase I, but also the Phase II enzymes and hence may provide additional insights from a biotransformation standpoint. When determining whether the metabolic stability of a drug is acceptable, we have to consider its impact on the efficacious dose. Metabolic stability of a molecule affects its clearance, which impacts dose size and frequency. For an oral drug, other factors such as solubility and permeability are also important for oral absorption and therefore exposure. Hence, a balance of these properties must be considered. Additionally, potency and volume of distribution should also be taken into account when deciding if the molecule has an acceptable metabolic clearance. For molecules with very high in vitro intrinsic clearance, it is also important to understand the sites on the molecule where metabolism occurs. Such an investigation is done by identifying metabolic soft spots in the molecule or ascertaining the metabolites arising from drug metabolism. This understanding can help influence the design and optimization of molecules. We have now covered the use of metabolic stability assays to determine apparent intrinsic clearance and in vitro metabolism estimate that can be used to predict hepatic clearance. Understanding a molecules clearance gives the drug-hunting team insight into how a compound may be dose to achieve efficacious exposure in patients.
