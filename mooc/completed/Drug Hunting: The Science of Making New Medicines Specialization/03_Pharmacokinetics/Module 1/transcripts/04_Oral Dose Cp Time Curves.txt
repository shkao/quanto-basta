By the end of this video, you'll be able to contrast the Cp time curves of an IV bolus relative to an oral dose. You will be able to calculate oral bioavailability and list factors that affected drugs, oral bioavailability. On the left are IV bolus, Cp time data points. We can sketch a curve through these points. Absorption is instantaneous and distribution is often complete before the first blood draw. Therefore, always see in this curve is the drop in Cp from drug clearance via metabolism and excretion, which gives rise to observed elimination. To the right, are Cp time points for an orally dose drug. That's oral drug, PO, that's per OS through the mouth. The curve through these points starts at Cp a 0 with a rise to a C max, which occurs at t max. Then falls very similarly to the IV bolus curve. The rising region at the start is the absorption phase. The falling region is the elimination phase. The oral curve has an area under the curve, which is one way to measure drug exposure, C max, the peak Cp concentration is another way to describe drug exposure. Here are the two curves overlaid on the same axes, IV in blue and oral in red. These are the same drug, same doses, different routes of administration. Because the dose sizes are identical, you might expect exposures to be the same. They normally are not, normally exposure from the oral dose is less than exposure for the IV dose. The reduction in oral exposure arises from incomplete oral drug absorption. Let's now see how we quantify the difference in exposure and more thoroughly explain why oral absorption may be incomplete. Here is some key information from the IV and oral curves, the size of the doses, both 20 mg and AUC from each dose. These data can be used to determine another key pharmacokinetic parameter, oral bioavailability, F. Bioavailability is reported as a fractional value from 0 to 1 or as a percentage. Here is the equation for calculating F. Note that any differences in IV and oral doses are accommodated in the equation. For our drug based on the AUC and dose values, the oral bioavailability is 0.75 or 75%. That's fine. But where did the other 25% of the oral dose go? Why is absorption not 100%? There are many possible reasons. Perhaps the drug has poor solubility. Perhaps the drug has low membrane permeability. Some drugs cross membranes well, but are pumped back into the GI tract by efflux transporters. Drugs can be metabolized within the gut lining. This is the intestinal gut or gastric first-pass effect or while passing through the liver, the hepatic first-pass effect in route to the general circulation. All of these factors can reduce oral bioavailability. The metabolic stability of any drug is important to understand, especially for oral drugs. An oral drug with low metabolic stability will show a large first-pass effect, reduced absorption, low bioavailability, and low drug exposure for a patient. Any drug, oral or otherwise with low metabolic stability will show increased hepatic clearance, which will reduce the drug's half-life and further decrease drug exposure for a patient. For these reasons, drug hunting team spend considerable time understanding the metabolic stability of hits and leads during the discovery stage. We have now contrasted IV and oral Cp time data. We have seen the equation for calculating oral bioavailability. We have listed selected factors that influence oral bioavailability.
