By the end of this video, you will be able to define drug drug interactions, DDIs. You'll be able to describe how DDIs are identified, and be able to visualize how DDIs affect the Cp-time curve of a drug. A drug drug interaction, or DDI, is an interaction between a drug and another substance that prevents the drug from performing as expected. The other substance may be a different drug, food, or dietary supplements. Our discussion focuses on pharmacokinetic consequences of DDIs. A DDI may cause an increase in drug exposure, which can lead to safety risks. Alternatively, a consequence may be reduced exposure and a loss of drug efficacy. Every DDI has a perpetrator and victim. As their names imply, perpetrators are drugs that cause DDIs, while victims are drugs directly affected by DDIs. Perpetrators typically cause DDIs either by inhibition or induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters. Assays determine the perpetrator potency based on the drug's impact on an enzyme or transporter functional activity using a probe substrate. Inhibitors can be reversible or time-dependent. Different assay formats, such as co-incubating or pre-incubating the test compound, are used to characterize the type of inhibition. Enzyme inhibition is typically investigated using human liver microsomes, whereas transporters and enzyme induction is determined using either hepatocytes or cells expressing the transporter of interest. Compounds are classified as low, moderate, or high risk based on the potency data. This binning is useful during the early lead optimization phase to identify DDI liabilities. However, as the compound progresses, additional information such as the compound's predicted clinical exposure needs to be taken into account for calculating the clinical risk. Assessing victim DDI liability is more involved compared to identifying perpetrators and requires the determination of the specific enzyme or transporter in the clearance of the compound. In addition, a thorough understanding of the compound's elimination, clearance, and fraction metabolized or transporters is important in estimating the DDI liability. The risk is highest if a single pathway, such as metabolism, is responsible for the compound's elimination, and, if metabolism is mediated through a single enzyme. In other words, if fraction metabolized is 100%. Victim DDI studies often involve CYP 450 phenotyping assays, which use liver microsomes incubated with a CYP 450 inhibitor and the test compound to estimate the fraction metabolized. Recombinant CYP 450 enzymes can also be used to determine clearance from each CYP isoform. Victim DDI studies, which require a deep understanding of the compound's PK properties, are not typically performed during early lead optimization. We can visualize pharmacokinetic drug drug interactions with CP-time curves. Here is a typical single-dose oral CP time-curve for drug A in a patient. We've also shown the plasma concentrations required for efficacy and above which toxicity is expected. Let's assume that this drug undergoes primarily hepatic clearance. If the same patient begins to also take a drug that inhibits drug A's metabolism, how might the new drug A CP-time curve appear? Here we go, the dotted line is still drug A, but it has been affected by the other drug. Hepatic clearance is lower, so now the Cmax and area under curve are higher and the half life is longer. A dose of drug A that was safe is now potentially toxic. Let's now assume that our same patient, instead of taking a metabolic enzyme inhibitor, begins to take an inducer of the enzyme responsible for its metabolism. Here is the new drug A CP-time curve. The dotted line is still drug A, but it has been affected by the other drug. Hepatic clearance is higher, so now the Cmax and AUC are lower and the half life is shorter. A dose of drug A that was efficacious now lacks efficacy as the exposure doesn't reach the plasma concentration efficacy threshold. These are examples of drug drug interactions and why a drug hunting team needs to consider whether these interactions may occur with a potential drug candidate. In particular, drugs that are potent inhibitors of multiple metabolic enzymes or critical drug metabolizing enzymes, especially CYP 3A4 and 3A5, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 are less attractive as leads due to the potential clinical DDI risk for patients on multiple medications. We have now defined DDIs and described how DDIs are identified. By seeing the impact that DDIs can have upon drugs, clearance, half life, and exposure, we now understand why DDIs are so closely monitored by drug hunting teams.
