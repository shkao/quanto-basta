You by the end of this video, you will be able to define anticipated human dose AHD. You will be able to list the types of data, that facilitate accurate prediction of AHD. Finally, you will be able to describe the importance of AHD, in drug discovery. You an anticipated human dose, can be described as the dose range over which we would expect to see clinical efficacy based upon the predicted human pharmacokinetics, and the PKPD target. The PKPD target, is either the efficacious drug exposures observed in preclinical animal pharmacology models. Or potency from in vitro PKPD models, corrected for plasma protein binding. The relevant primary PK parameters for dose prediction, include volume of distribution, clearance and bioavailability. Anticipated human dose also includes, the dosing frequency, which is the interval at which the intended dose is administered, and is influenced by the drug's half-life. Typical dosing frequencies are once a day, twice a day or in some cases, even once a week or monthly. Dose and dosing frequency are both important components of anticipated human dose, as they are interlinked and can impact efficacy and safety. For example, a 100 milligram once a day dose versus a 50 milligram twice a day dose, could result in different efficacy and safety outcomes. Accuracy of anticipated human dose, relies on the successful prediction of human PK, as well as a deep understanding of the PKPD. Insights on human PKPD, are derived from animal models that mimic human biology or disease, relevant biomarkers or efficacy endpoints are measured. Alongside the PK to determine the drivers for effect, and the PKPD target. In vitro PK models, such as liver microsomes for predicting clearance and flow based cellular systems. For in vitro PKPD predictions are also utilized. Prediction of human PK parameters, namely clearance, volume of distribution, half life, and bioavailability. Are performed using a variety of translational models, the selection of which depends on considerations specific to the compound of interest. To name a few, these include the compound's physical chemical properties. Mechanistic understanding of the compound's disposition, correlation between in vitro and in vivo data. As well as comparison of PK parameters across species. Quantitative modeling to the compound's predicted human PK, in conjunction with the PKPD target for desired efficacy, yields the anticipated human dose. One example of this type of quantitative modeling is PBPK, or physiology based PK. Which is a mathematical modeling approach that incorporates blood flow, tissue composition of organs, and the physiological processes. That are involved in disposition to define the overall pharmacokinetics of a drug. The primary purpose of anticipated human dose, is to enable selection of candidates at the end of the lead optimization phase. However, it can also help answer several questions that can mitigate the risk of failing in the clinic, due to suboptimal PK efficacy or safety. Some examples where anticipated human dose can assist include, selecting the starting dose for first in human studies. Determining potential for drug accumulation following multiple dosing. Understand the potential for nonlinearity and exposure with increasing dose, estimating safety margins. Determining the extent of target occupancy. Determining the risk for patient variability in PK, estimating cost of goods, evaluating patient compliance. The feasibility for drug combination nations, and the effect of formulation on PK. We have now defined anticipated human dose, listed the types of information that allow accurate prediction of anticipated human dose. And described some of the important roles that anticipated human dose serves, during drug discovery.
