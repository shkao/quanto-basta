Welcome everyone. This is one of our interviews that we do for the course. I'm sure you've seen these before and today I'm pleased to introduce Juliet Nabakka. Juliet is a Scientist at Novartis, and I'm going to go ahead and let her introduce herself and tell us what her position is. Thank you for having me and giving me the opportunity to speak to different students. My name is Juliet Nabakka, as you mentioned, and I am a Principal Scientist too at Novartis. I got into this role in a generally relatively traditional route. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in chemistry from UCLA. I then went on to graduate school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It was during my third year within my graduate program at the time I was doing organic chemistry, that I was made aware of an opportunity to work as a medicinal chemist at a local pharmaceutical company. So I applied and I obtained that position. Once I got into it, I really loved it. A year into that position, I decided to move across the country and move closer to home and I joined Novartis, and they had a site in San Diego, which is where I've been since then. So that is how I got into this role, and I've been working on different projects within Novartis for the last 19 and a half years. Juliet, if I can ask, what really sparked your interest after being in grad school and then you saw drug discovery? Was there anything particular that really fascinated you? To be quite honest, I wasn't familiar at all with medicinal chemistry. I had never heard of it. Like most students, I gain exposure, particularly in organic and inorganic chemistry. As an undergraduate, I worked in a research lab, and we're doing mainly in organic chemistry, particularly born chemistry, and so that was the extent of my exposure. I did take a material science class, but beyond that, not much. When I applied to graduate school, I went straight into the inorganic chemistry division. That's what I knew, and that's what I've been exposed to. But while I was there, I actually had a colleague who was in the lab with me that left with a master's degree and I'd been working in a philosopher company and talking to her, she started telling me a little bit more about medicinal chemistry and then when a position became available, that's how I found out about it. I applied and once I got it there, I really enjoyed it. My plan had been if I didn't like it, I can come back and finish the PhD in organic chemistry, but that wasn't the case. I took that path and never turned back. Seeing opportunities and going after the good opportunities that are part of your story. Correct, absolutely. That's great. With Novartis, what are some of your typical day-to-day activities that you have as a scientist? Great. I work as a medicinal chemist doing synthetic organic chemistry. The role of my job is to design and create pharmaceutical active molecules that can be used to treat a particular disease or condition. So my day-to-day experiences are mainly to set up experiments to synthesis the molecules. We do, of course, purify these molecules. We do characterize these molecules to ensure that what we wanted to make is in fact what we've made. At that point, we hand over our compounds to the biologists who then do the in vitriol testing. They run them in their asses or if you're scaling up a compound for PK studies, then you do just that. We also do a lot of data analysis. The data we received back from the biologists or from PK studies, we do analyze this data to ensure that the changes we're making on the molecules, depending on the scaffold working on, are beneficial and if they are not, what is the next change or next modification for the scaffold that we need to make. We do spend quite a bit of time doing data analysis and using, there's a variety of different software programs that you can use to become more efficient analyzing your data because you may make 20 compounds and you need to look at what the data is saying about the changes you're making. Then from there, improve your design. There is also a some portion of time that we spend presenting. Communicating our data is important. So we do presentations within Chemistry groups, within teams, with the biologists, so we can always communicate our data so that you get feedback from the multidisciplinary team that makes up the projects and see collectively what we can improve upon and how people feel about the data because everyone has a sometimes different way they see the data. When you say team, how big is a team typically? It depends. You can have a project team that may have maybe five chemists on it. Suddenly three four biologists on it that do some of the vitriol asses and even within there may be several different types of asses you're running, counter screens, and whatever is involved in the project. Generally, some pharmacologists because they run a lot of PK studies, some people do the formulation for the compounds. How big the team is depends on how far along the project is. If you're in the optimization phase, there may be a bigger team. Now you bring in a few other people. So it really depends on the project.
Your skills are really as a chemist and that's what you brought to Novartis. Can you talk a little bit about learning to communicate with people within other disciplines and the challenges and rewards that have come with that? Yes. We are trained as a chemist, but as you start to work on a team with biologist, first of all, you'll learn a lot of biology from them. The skills that I bring is the synthetic organic chemistry skills, but once I work on a project, I come to learn a lot more about the biology of the project. That you learn slowly over the years. I think the skill set that you build upon is learning more about what the Pica scientists are thinking, what the biologists are thinking, and vice versa, they learn maybe a little bit about chemistry in terms of what your thought process is, how you think about, let me replace a fluorine with a hydrogen, are they similar in size? With that effect be bigger or smaller than putting a phenol group instead of a fluorine? Just very different things. I suppose, as a chemist, I learn a little bit more about what the other scientists think and how they approach their job and the things that are important to them, but I think vice versa, they learn a little bit about what we chemists think as we approach the drug discovery design process. Over time you grow in your ability, I'm sure, to communicate with other members of the team. Correct. Yes. Yes. I think with the more presentations that you give, you learn to communicate better. The message has to be clear.
Depending on the audience, you can decide how much chemistry you dive into.
You learn how to communicate differently based on your audience. Certainly. You learn a lot of the lingo to use depending on the audience as well. When you thought about going into the pharmacy, so you'd finish this internship and had come out to the West Coast, did you consider working at a smaller company or a larger company? Was that ever a decision that you had to make? It's interesting you ask. When I started with my master's degree, I interviewed a really small pharmaceutical company, and then I interviewed a larger one, which was actually [inaudible], they had a site in North Carolina. I definitely went for the bigger organization at the time as well. Then with the opportunity [inaudible] came up. I suddenly wanted to do a larger pharmaceutical company, and for several reasons, yes. Could you share a couple of those reasons with us at all or? Sure. Well, a large pharmaceutical to me I see as being more robust and structured. What that offers to me as an employee is stability. Additionally, the opportunities and the probability of you being exposed to much wider disease areas, projects that span a variety of different areas, I think for me was important, and that has been my experience here. For example, I've worked on projects that were in metabolic diseases. I had the most amazing opportunity to work in infectious diseases for a short period of time. More recently, I've been in the respiratory disease space. You gain a lot more exposure and opportunities. But also the resources are better, training-wise, access to various types of training, whether it's software programs for data analysis, or whether it's just training opportunities or attending conferences. Over the span of your career with a large pharmaceutical company, I think you get a much deeper and broader exposure , and learning experience. That's great. Thank you. If you can share what you're comfortable sharing with, what you're working with right now at Novartis and aspects that are important to you for that project as well as aspects of that project that are important to patients. What I'm working on now is on identifying small molecules for the treatment of COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This project, interestingly, I have worked on two different times with different targets. This is important of course because there are a lot of medications that can suppress the symptoms, but not as much. But there's really no real treatment for COPD, and so I think it is a disease that certainly other companies are also working on. Sure. That's great. On TV, you can't avoid seeing commercials for COPD. Absolutely. What are some of the big challenges that you see in drug discovery, or challenges in hunting for a new drug? When I think about that, I think of the word complexity. I never thought of drug discovery as being a complex Think. But the complexity, I think presents itself in different ways and based on the project, there is complexity in SAR sometimes the structure, activity, relationships. What's surprising is that you may make small changes to a molecule, but can have a drastically different impact, sometimes not working when it's relatively small change and the SAR may not always make sense. You make some changes, it seems like you're getting some traction, and then all of a sudden you get a very flat SAR and nothing can work. It's not automatic, but with every change you make, you're either improving necessarily the properties that you want. I think that can be complex. Additionally, sometimes you have a compound that has a relatively good invitro profile. It looks potent and efficacious in the invitro access, but you go invivo and nothing is really working well. Sometimes there's a disconnect between what you're getting invitro. You wonder, do we have the right access if there's not correlation that can be complicated I think. Then of course, you may have a great invitro profile, great invivo results. Then you start to see species difference. Things are working in mice and rats, which is a lot of what we do in our pick studies in. Then you get to the higher species animals and there's no correlation, you wonder, will it work in humans? It can be quite complex depending on the project. Some of these things can be worked out. Sometimes the simulations we're making are not the best to gauge improvements, it can be quite complex in my opinion. There's definitely still plenty to learn in terms of the pathways and how they're connected and whether you get efficacy or not invivo. Sometimes the SAR doesn't make sense. You read about scaffolds that have activity cliffs. There's just no tolerance for changes.
In what percentage of the projects do you rely on x-ray data as a guiding tool?
I would say if we're working on a project well, where clearly the target is known, I think x-ray can help, but I don't think I've had as many experiences where that made all the difference in the world, I think sometimes it's a hit or miss, kind of like modeling. I'm on a project now where we do a lot of modeling. You will suggest a structure, it will get modeled and it seems, this looks okay, but guess this will be much better and then you make those other analogs and they're completely dead. People have very different opinions about how much to take to put in modeling by crystal structures. The computer aided design,
I think we have to use it because I think it gives us some guidance. But sometimes what I like to do, I've had some background in combinatorial chemistry. I do a lot of library parasynthesis and for me, I like to make at least 20 analogs, 50 analogs, depending on where the project is of course. But I like to make the compounds that have been suggested, but I also like to make things that would not necessarily fit because sometimes this actually happened on this project I'm working on. Something that shouldn't have worked actually, surprisingly, was very efficacious and very important. It depends as much as we take x-ray information, also the modeling, we also have to think outside the box and that for me is the part that I enjoy. The design aspect, making things that everyone else sometimes I actually don't tell my colleagues going to be, but I will make the eight that they want in addition to the other three that was suggested. But I always make a series of other 5, 6 compounds that people may not think are going to work. Sometimes that's where the magic comes. If you ask me the best part about this job is the design aspect. I love that. I like to be able to have the freedom to try different things to propose different molecules, because ultimately we don't know until we make it, until it's tested. That's my approach. That's fantastic. Juliet, thank you so much for making yourself available for this interview and sharing your experiences with the participants in the course. It's a pleasure meeting you and talking to you. Thank you so much. I definitely learned a lot in my time at Novartis and I won't trade it for anything. Fantastic. Thank you again. Thanks.
