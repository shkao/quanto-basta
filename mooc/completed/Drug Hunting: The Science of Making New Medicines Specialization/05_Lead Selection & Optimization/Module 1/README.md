# Module 1

## Interview with Juliet Nabakka

## Malaria Life Cycle

### Learning objectives

- Recognize malaria as a neglected tropical disease & unmet medical need
- Describe the life cycle of the malaria parasite
- List ideal properties of an anti-malaria treatment

### Overview of Malaria Incidences and Deaths

### Malaria Parasite Species

1. **Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)**
2. **Plasmodium vivax (Pv)**
3. **Plasmodium berghei (Pb)**

### Malaria Life Cycle

- **Mosquito Phase**: Transmission to humans through sporozoites.
- **Human Liver Phase**:
  - Sporozoites travel to the liver.
  - Infect hepatocytes.
  - Develop into schizonts.
  - **P. vivax**: Can form dormant hypnozoites.
- **Human Blood Phase**:
  - Schizonts release merozoites.
  - Merozoites infect red blood cells (RBCs).
  - Gametocytes are formed in the blood, which are then transmitted back to mosquitoes.

### Ideal qualities of antimalarial drugs

- Essential and ideal drug properties are typically outlined in a target product profile (TPP).
- Selected properties of an ideal antimalarial drug:
  - Active during both liver and blood stages
  - Blocks transmission
  - Fast-acting
  - Single, oral dose
  - High potency (â‰¤ 10 nM)
  - Long half-life (> 44 hrs)
