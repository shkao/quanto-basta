By the end of this video, you'll be able to examine the structure activity relationships or SAR of a compound series. You will also be able to summarize common SAR approaches in lead optimization. Here is a hit from the original phenotypic screening campaign for anti-malarial activity. For a hit, the molecule shows promising potency against both the 3D C7 and W2 malaria strains. For reference, potencies of three anti-malarial drugs are included. Note that as expected, pyrimethamine is much less active against the pyrimethamine resistant W2 strain. While promising, the hit compound is not as potent as the existing drugs. Structurally, the hit has an imidazolopiperazine core or IP core with three substituents. The SAR program initially focused on these three substituents to better understand the activity of the hit. The first part of the molecule to be investigated was the amino acid in the 7 position. As is often the case, changes are made to one part of the molecule while other parts are kept the same. For this SAR study, the chemist made large amounts of this precursor and then added different amino acids to the 7 position to test the activity. The results from a few different amino acids substituents are shown. From these and others, researchers found that the glycine and Alpha methyl alanine and unnatural amino acid had the best combination of activities in the 3D7 and W2 assays and were selected for continued exploration. While not obvious from the compounds in this small table, the researchers also learned that the amine must be an NH2 group. Additional substitution on the nitrogen decrease the potency of the compounds. The researchers next vary the aromatic ring in the two position of the IP core while using both glycine and Alpha methyl alanine in the 7 position. Only small substituents methyl, fluoro, and chloro, were tolerated in the 3 and 4 positions of the aromatic ring. Any substitutions in the two positions decrease potency. If R^2 was not an aromatic ring, then potency was completely lost. Substitution at the 5, 6 and 8 positions of the IP core was also investigated. At the 8 position, that's R^4, methyl groups can be introduced. Larger groups like isopropyl were less well tolerated and potency decreased. Dimethyl substitution was very well tolerated, especially as we can see in this compound here, and led to multiple highly potent compounds. On the other hand, substitution in the 5 or 6 positions on the IP core was not well tolerated. We can see those in these two rows with these methyl substituents and our potencies go down. Finally, a carbonyl at the 6 position was explored in a few compounds. We have one example shown to the right. In combination with certain other substituents, the carbonyl compounds were reasonably potent. These results summarize the major SAR findings. Note that these are just the highlights. Many additional molecules were synthesized and assayed for potency. We have seen a series of analogues that explore the SAR of anti-malarial activity on an imidazolopiperazine core. This series highlights some of the standard methods and substitution patterns that are tested while studying the SAR of a compound series.
