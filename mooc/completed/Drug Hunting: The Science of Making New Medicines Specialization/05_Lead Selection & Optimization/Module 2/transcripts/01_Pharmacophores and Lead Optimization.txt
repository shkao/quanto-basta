After watching this video, you will be able to describe a common approach for defining a compound's pharmacophore. You will also be able to outline some general ideas central to lead optimization. Once we have identified promising hit or lead compounds, we then have a challenge. We need to figure out why and how do these compounds interact with our target. What are the specific features that allow it to have the properties that it shows? This minimal feature set for interaction with the target is something called the pharmacophore. On the left we have a compound. It could be a screening hit. This compound has some structural features. We see some non-polar groups, namely the phenol group on the left. The alcohol is a polar group and perhaps engages with the target through a hydrogen bond with the OH. The nitrogen on the bottom of the ring has a lone pair and it may function as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Finally, we have a substituent over on the right. Collectively, these groups are held together through this quinoline core structure. The quinoline is the scaffold for the molecule. If all these groups are determined to be important for binding of this molecule, the drug hunting team may think about these groups more abstractly. For activity, we need a larger non-polar group on one side. The larger group should have nearby hydrogen bond donating groups, as well as a hydrogen bond acceptor. On the other side of the compound, we can tolerate additional substitution. These generalized required features of inactive compound describes the pharmacophore. Based on its minimum feature set, the team would prepare or search for similar structures that also fulfill these criteria. The outcome of this work could be a lead. To the right is a possible lead, while this lead is different from the hit, the lead does preserve all the key features of the hit. Well hopefully improving upon some of the properties. This process of connecting structural features in a molecule to its observed biological activity defines the structure activity relationships or SAR of a compound. Every drug program tries to establish the SAR of hits from a screening campaign. Let's back away from some of the structural details and see how this process of lead optimization often unfolds across the top is a scale going from less optimized to a more optimized. We are optimizing the properties of the lead. Those properties could be potency or pharmacokinetics or toxicity, or most likely a combination of all of these properties together. We'll start on the left with a lead. It is relatively un-optimized. The medicinal chemist will make many structural changes to the lead, different groups in different places on the scaffold, each compound is a new analogue of the lead. Some new analogs will be less favorable than the original structure, but some will be improvements and move to the right. On our optimization scale. One of the new analogs may stand out from the other sufficiently to be considered a new lead and even be named a second-generation lead. The preparation of new analogs of the second-generation lead will again yield some molecules that are worse and others better. A breakthrough and property optimization may provide a third-generation lead. As this process continues, a lead may be identified that is sufficiently safe and effective in pre-clinical studies, to me nominated as a candidate for submission to the relevant health authorities. With health authority approval, the drug may be advanced into the clinic, which is indeed the ultimate goal of lead optimization. We have now been introduced to the lead optimization process. We start with a promising hit or lead. We then identify its key features and begin to understand the SAR around this molecule. Than modifications are sequentially performed on this compound to improve its properties, hopefully getting us to a potential new drug
