By the end of this video, you will be able to list specific measurable properties of an ideal hit compound for a drug discovery program using the antimalarial program as an example. You will also be able to identify potential weaknesses of a hit compound found through a screening campaign and describe how those weaknesses can guide an optimization strategy. The screening campaign relied on the 3D7 phenotypic screen as the primary assay. Over two million compounds were screened and emphasis was placed on finding active compounds that are structurally differentiated from existing antimalarials, namely amino quinolones such as chloroquine and endoperoxides such as artemisinin. This will hopefully address challenges of emerging resistance to these drugs and avoid some of their undesired side effects. Three criteria were used to identify hits. Number 1, less than one micromolar activity against a wild-type Pf string 3D7, as well as a drug-resistant strain W2, indicating that the mechanism is different from that of existing drugs. Number 2, a good safety index of over 20-fold against human hepatocyte-derived HU H7 cells. This indicates that the hit has low toxicity to human cells. Number 3, easy synthesis and multiple compounds from the scaffold showing anti-parasitic activity indicating that the hit is tractable. The hit shown to the right, which contains an imidazolopiperazine scaffold, fulfilled all three criteria. It has good activity against both the wild-type PF3D7, and drug-resistant W2 strains while exhibiting no measurable toxicity against the human liver cell line, HU H7. The main core of the imidazolopiperazine was assembled in a single step and multiple analogues from that series showed good activity. The properties of this initial hit were then further characterize to define the goals for the lead optimization campaign. Compound was highly soluble, indicating that solubility need not be a main focus of the optimization program. A basic amine was present in the R1 side chain. Basic amines are readily protonated and often increase water solubility. Unfortunately, basic amines are often associated with herd channel inhibition, which can lead to arrhythmia. The hit compound bound to the herd channel with an IC_50 of 19 micromolar, making it something to monitor during optimization. The compound did not inhibit any of the most important cytochrome p450 isoforms and therefore had a low potential for causing drug-drug interactions, DDIs. Another characteristic examined was the oral bioavailability in mice, an oral dose of 20 makes per kg showed poor plasma exposure, indicating the presence of metabolic soft spots are overall poor permeability properties that would need to be addressed. Researchers suspected the aromatic ring of R^2, as well as the R^3 group represented sites of high metabolic reactivity. The initial goals of the optimization, we're therefore to improve potency and oral exposure and mitigate any potential herd liability. We have now listed examples of key criteria that could be used to define an acceptable hit molecule. In this case, for an antimalarial program. We have also described some of the potential liabilities that might be observed in a hit molecule, which then will guide the direction of the lead optimization efforts.
