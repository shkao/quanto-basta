By the end of this video, you will be able to describe factors in the design of animal disease models. You will be able to prioritize compounds based on in vivo data. Finally, you will be able to list some examples of key safety criteria monitored during lead optimization. A key goal during lead optimization of an antimalarial compound is to establish efficacy of the compounds against the plasmodium parasite in an animal model. This is critical for an antimalarial program to minimize the risk of failure in the clinic. This also aligns with the need in symptomatic blood stage malaria patients where the antimalarial must clear the parasite both quickly and completely. Reducing the chance of the parasite developing drug resistance. Both in animals and humans, the biomarker used to demonstrate drug efficacy is a reduction in parasitemia. A key challenge of in vivo models, particularly of disease models, is how translatable they are to the human disease. In malaria disease models, the parasite that infects humans is different from the parasite that infects rodents. Correlation between the disease model and the outcome in the clinic can therefore be challenging. In this antimalarial program, plasmodium berghei, P berghei was used to infect rodents while not used in this program. More recently, a severe combined immunodeficiency SCID model of P Sapar and blood stage infections has been developed. Because this model uses the parasite that infects humans, it can lower the risk of not achieving compound efficacy in the clinic. In this antimalarial program, researchers looked at two in vivo parameters to assess the efficacy of molecules. One reduction in parasitemia the activity column two days of survival of treated animals. The survival column parasitemia involves counting the number of malaria parasites in a blood sample. The study had three arms 130 MiG per KIG dose, 1100 MiG per KIG dose and 330 MiG per KIG doses over three days. Established antimalarials chloroquine and artesinate were used as positive control compounds. As expected, these control compounds showed a dose dependent parasitemia reduction and increase of survival. In this study, compounds like 22 and 24 with seven substitution reduced parasitemia and increased survival compared to the seven unsubstituted compounds 34 and 36. While unsubsituted piprozines showed better mouse PK properties such as high exposures and low clearance. The higher exposures did not translate into greater in vivo efficacy. Compound 34 showed an extremely steep dose response and doses of 100 migs per KIG were required to achieve parasitemia reductions of greater than 90%. Note that even at the lowest dose, compound 22 dramatically reduces parasitemia and extends survival. During lead optimization, safety is as important as optimizing efficacy and PK properties. The pipperzine compounds were known to carry an in vitro hERG liability, which was reduced by at least two to threefold through seven substitution as seen in compound 22. Other in vitro tests can provide additional insight into toxicity risks. Cytochrome P 450 inhibition is a potential risk as this can lead to drug drug interactions. Compound 22 was inactive against key CYP isoforms, munogenic potential is examined using many aims and micronucleus tests. Which measure single base pair mutations and chromosomal strand breaks, respectively. Again, compound 22 was found to be inactive. Compounds like antimalarials and antibiotics act in a cytotoxic manner, but cytotoxicity against mammalian cells would be undesirable. Studies using multiple mammalian cell lines demonstrated it would take greater than 100 fold more of compound 22 to be cytotoxic to mammalian cells compared to the malaria parasite. Which is an adequate safety window. In total, the toxicity profile of compound 22 appeared to be very promising, and no further optimization to minimize potential safety risks was needed. We have now described animal disease models, ranked antimalarial compounds based on their in vivo efficacy using parasitemia reduction as a biomarker. And listed some safety criteria monitored during optimization.
