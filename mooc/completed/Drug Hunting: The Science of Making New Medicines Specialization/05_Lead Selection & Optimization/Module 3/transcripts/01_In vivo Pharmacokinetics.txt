After watching this video, you will be able to define IVIVC, which stands for in vitro, in vivo correlation. You will be able to correlate structural features of compounds to their In Vivo PK properties. Finally, you will be able to describe how in vivo PK data are used to prioritize lead compounds. In vitro assays such as metabolic stability assays help researchers prioritize molecules from the lead series for more resource intensive in vivo PK studies. Rodents such as mice and rats, most commonly serve as the initial PK species. In vivo, PK studies allow determination of key parameters including clearance, volume of distribution, and half-life. Clearance is of particular interest since not only is cleared drug unavailable to elicit a therapeutic effect, it can ultimately impact the dosing regimen. To minimize animal PK studies, researchers try to understand if the in vitro assay data are predictive of the observed in vivo data in each species. By building this in vitro, in vivo correlation IVIVC, researchers can understand more about clearance mechanisms and learn how to most effectively apply the in vitro data. Observed mouse clearance was found to be lower in seven unsubstituted piperazines, like 34 and 36. Seven substituted compounds such as 15 and 22 generally displayed higher clearance. There was a significant improvement in the mouse clearance between the eight unsubstituted compounds like 15 and the eight dimethylated compounds. This observation was not predicted by the mouse liver microsomal assay, which measures sit mediated phase one oxidation. This in vitro, in vivo discrepancy highlights that other factors besides hepatic oxidative metabolism can contribute to observed in vivo clearance. The seven substituted compounds, 15 and 22 showed higher volume of distribution, which occurs when compounds distribute from the plasma to other tissues. Compound 22 was found to have a high blood to plasma ratio of 3.5, meaning the compound is more highly concentrated in red blood cells than the surrounding plasma. A high blood to plasma ratio will be beneficial for an anti-malarial because drug access to the infected red blood cells will improve efficacy against the parasites. Partitioning into red blood cells partially explains the higher VD values. The most promising compounds were advanced into an oral rat PK study. Understanding PK in the rat is important because the rat is a preferred preclinical toxicology model. The results for three key compounds are shown here. Based on rat liver microsomal as a result, some imidazole piperazines were predicted to have non-optimal PK properties. After a 20 mg per kg dose, compound 29 was below the limit of quantification in the plasma. All Alpha methylaniline derivatives were subsequently deprioritized. Consistent with the rat metabolic stability studies, compounds 22 and 34 had the highest in vivo exposures based on area under curve and C_max. Ultimately, when considering the spectrum of desirable characteristics, compound 22 was selected for additional study. To enable the anticipated rat toxicology studies and ascending dose rat oral PK study with compound 22 use doses of 10, 30, and 100 mgs per kg. For many compounds, exposure tends to increase linearly with dose. If the dose is doubled, then C_max and AUC also double. Compound 22, however, showed an over proportional exposure relative to dose. One possible explanation for this observation is the saturation of efflux transporters at higher doses, which was in line with the partial efflux, a compound 22 seen in earlier KCO2 permeability studies. This over proportional exposure was advantageous for the toxicology studies. Since exposure multiples well above the anticipated therapeutic exposure need to be achieved. We have now defined in vitro, in vivo correlation and described how in vitro data can inform compound selection for in vivo PK studies. Anti-malarial compounds were correlated with in vivo PK parameters. Furthermore, we learned about two key PK properties, clearance and volume of distribution, and how in vivo PK studies are used to prioritize lead compounds.
