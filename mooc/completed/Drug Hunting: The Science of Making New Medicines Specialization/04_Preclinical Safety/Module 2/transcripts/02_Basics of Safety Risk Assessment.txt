By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to describe how to view toxicity within the context of a molecule's indication. You will also be able to demonstrate how to quantify the safety of a molecule.
As we think about measuring toxicity of a molecule, we often must define which adverse events are most relevant to a patient and how much risk are patients willing to accept. The table on the screen shows some factors to consider. Let's assume that we have a molecule with an adverse effect maybe a frequent incidence of headaches. Now, let's look at the table with proposed uses. If our molecule prevents osteoporosis and is taken over a long period, then from a patient perspective, a high probability of headaches will likely be a key barrier to taking the drug. Keep in mind that frequency or likelihood of the adverse effect is also important. If both were very low, say developing a headache was unlikely or might only occur every few months, a patient with osteoporosis might very well accept the relatively minor risk to obtain the benefit from the drug. If on the other hand, our molecule can potentially treat cancer, a patient will likely overlook the headache risk. In fact, cancer patients often accept drugs with significantly higher risks and more severe side effects due to the severity of the disease and limited treatment options.
On the screen is a set of curves that show response curves for both the desired therapeutic effect, pharmacodynamics that's in green, and a toxic effect that's in red. Note the relationship between the PD and toxicity curves will be different for every drug. Exposure is quantified on the x-axis. Exposure can be quantified in different ways, such as the peak concentration of a drug C MAX or the area under the curve, AUC. At an exposure that is just high enough to generate a pharmacological response, the toxicity is nearly 0.
Just causing a response with no therapeutic benefit, however, is not satisfactory for a drug. A higher exposure will be required for a therapeutic effect, and a higher exposure may also lead to a higher risk or incidence of toxicity. Furthermore, because patient responses to a particular dose of a drug are variable, drugs are normally dosed above a minimally efficacious level to achieve the desired therapeutic response or registration endpoint. Again, as the intended exposure increases, the incidence of toxicity also rises. The difference between the required exposure for a particular amount of therapeutic benefit and the exposure that triggers unacceptable toxicity allows quantification of safety parameters for a molecule. Two such measures are therapeutic index and safety margin. These measures are not identical, but both attempt to convey the balance of risks and benefits for a molecule. We will discuss them in more depth in another video.
By specifically defining the types of toxicity relevant to a particular molecule and program, we can generate quantitative measures to weigh the risks and benefits for a molecule.
