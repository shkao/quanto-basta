# Module 2

## In Vivo Toxicology and Safety Studies

### Learning objectives

- List common animal species encountered in preclinical safety studies
- Explain reasons for selection of particular species

### General toxicology studies

- Performed late during pre-clinical drug discovery phase
- Provides information for the IND/CTA
- Normally includes one rodent and one non-rodent species

**Common rodents:**

- Mouse or rat

**Common non-rodents:**

- Dog or non-human primate

### Selection of species

- Molecules behave differently across various species.
- Each species' metabolism, PK tendencies, and inclination toward adverse effects are considered.
- Key question:  
  Does an animal species express a homolog of the human target that is modulated by the drug candidate?

### Considerations for biological drugs

- Common biologics: antibodies and proteins
- On-target biologics toxicity is difficult to investigate in animal species that do not express a closely related homolog to the human target (easiest in monkeys)
- Protein therapeutics can elicit misleading immunologic responses in species that differ greatly from humans

### Animal welfare

- **Animal Welfare Act** (United States)
- Regulations stipulate humane treatment, transport, and housing of all animals.
- **3Rs** – Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement
- Better animal welfare leads to more reliable safety data

## Basics of Safety Risk Assessment

### Toxicity requires context

| Proposed use                                         | How much risk one may be willing to accept |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Prevention of disease in healthy persons             | Less                                       |
| Severe disease with no or limited treatment options  | More                                       |
| Long duration of treatment needed                    | Less                                       |
| Short duration of treatment needed                   | More                                       |
| Vulnerable patient groups                            | Less                                       |

### Quantifying safety

- **Therapeutic index**: The range between the dose that provides a therapeutic effect and the dose that causes toxicity.
- **Safety margin**: The difference between the effective dose and the dose that results in unacceptable toxicity.

The graph shows:

- The green curve represents the pharmacodynamics (PD) response, indicating therapeutic effects.
- The red curve represents the safety endpoint, indicating toxicity.
- As exposure increases, the probability of reaching unacceptable toxicity rises, making it indication-specific.

## Therapeutic Index & Quantifying Safety

### Learning objectives

- Describe how safety is measured during the discovery phase
- Define therapeutic index

### Measuring safety

- A drug must be **"safe and effective"** for approval.
- Safety can improve drug acceptance by both healthcare professionals and patients.
- Safety profile of a drug is based on a spectrum of possible adverse effects.
- Preclinical safety studies help determine a dosing regimen that avoids adverse effects.

### Therapeutic index – potency-based

- **Azithromycin (antibiotic)**:
  - Target potency = \( K_i^{\text{target}} \)
  - Off-target potency = \( K_i^{\text{IKr}} \)
  
- **Therapeutic Index (TI)**:
  \[
  TI = \frac{K_i^{\text{IKr}}}{K_i^{\text{target}}}
  \]

  (Higher TI = lower risk)

### Therapeutic index – exposure-based

- **Exposure** = \( C_{\text{max}} \) or AUC
- **Therapeutic Index (TI)**:
  \[
  TI = \frac{\text{NOAEL}}{\text{predicted human therapeutic exposure}}
  \]
- **NOAEL**: No observed adverse effect level (in animals)
