By the conclusion of this video, you'll be able to describe the different stages of a drug hunting program. You will also be able to list representative pre-clinical safety studies that are performed at each stage. Finally, you will be able to outline the oversight role of regulatory agencies. Drug discovery and development are often described as a pipeline. On the screen is a pipe it starts with a chemical species on the left and finishes with a drug product on the right. The process starts with the discovery phase during which large numbers of molecules are screened. Leads are selected and optimized and a final lead compound is chosen following a successful IND, investigational new drug application in the US or CTA clinical trial application in many other countries, the clinical candidate advances through the various phases of clinical trials. During the development phase, data from the discovery and development phases are compiled in the NDA new drug application, or MAA marketing authorization application. The US and other countries respectively. Approved drugs are then launch to meet unmet medical needs. Let's see where pre-clinical safety testing occurs along this pathway. Here is the same graphic with call-outs for specific safety tests. All the listed items fall under the umbrella of pre-clinical safety. We want to mention each of these items, but let's hit some highlights. Early discovery testing focuses on in vitro testing. Secondary pharmacology test screen molecules against a group of targets and pathways that are frequently associated with adverse effects. In vitro genotoxicity would include the Ames test, which is an assay for mutagenicity and therefore a potential indicator for cancer risks. In late discovery, safety pharmacology refers to in vivo test for short-term cardiac, neurological, and respiratory risks. These are key tests for a successful IND application or CTA. If a molecule advances into the clinic, longer pre-clinical studies will be performed in parallel. Some of these are standardized tests, while others may be designed to answer questions specific to the action of the clinical candidate. Examples include monitoring compounds, potential reproductive, embryo, fetal, and developmental effects. These studies is assess risk to women of child-bearing potential for adverse reproductive effects. As a molecule advances into phase III and if the molecule is intended for chronic use, that is six months or longer. Long-term, two-year duration, carcinogenicity tests will be performed. Pre and postnatal toxicology studies are also performed concurrently with later clinical trials.
Two of the most commonly mentioned regulatory agencies, or the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA and European Medicines Agency, EMA. The FDA, EMA and other drug regulatory agencies oversee the safety standards of new and existing drugs within their jurisdictions. The standards of the FDA and EMA are requirements that a drug sponsor must meet as the FDA and EMA have the authority to deny or revoke drug approval. Distinct from regulatory agencies is the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Human Use, the ICH. The ICH strives to develop common guidelines that are acceptable to many regulatory agencies. Such guidelines facilitate the creation of new drugs while minimizing the need for different testing for each regulatory agency. Many tests for safety and efficacy must be performed according to good practices, which are noted as GxP. The x is a wildcard that denotes a specific type of practice, for example GLP stands for good laboratory practice. GxP, are quality guidelines that ensure an activity is properly documented. Pre-clinical safety studies that directly support clinical studies are generally required to follow GLP guidelines. Other GxPs are relevant to drug programs. Drugs are synthesized and formulated under GMP, good manufacturing practice guidelines. Clinical trials are performed under good clinical practice or GCP guidelines. FDA, EMA, and ICH documents specify required GxP is needed for each stage of a drug program. Safety risks during pre-clinical studies are minimized through a robust pre-clinical safety testing program. For this reason, pre-clinical safety results are closely monitored by drug regulatory agencies worldwide.
