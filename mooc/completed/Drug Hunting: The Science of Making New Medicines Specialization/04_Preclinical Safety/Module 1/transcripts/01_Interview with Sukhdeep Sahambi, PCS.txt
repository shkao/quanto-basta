It is my pleasure to have with us Sukhdeep Sahambi, and she is one of the scientists at Novartis and Sukhdeep, I'm going to hand it straight to you to allow you to introduce yourself please.
>> Speaker 2: Thank you, Erland, thank you for the opportunity to record this video. I am a preclinical safety assessment expert in Nevada's institutes of biomedical research. So, commonly what I do is known as PCSPTM. PCS stands for pre-clinical safety, PTM stands for project team member. So, what I do is ensure that pre-clinical safety assessment is done appropriately to support the ongoing developmental phase of a compound that I am supporting in that particular team. >> Speaker 1: Fantastic, could you tell us a little bit about your educational background please? >> Speaker 2: Yes, I have a PhD, I did a couple of postdocs, and I am a diplomat of American board of toxicology. So, my schooling, all of my schooling up till PhD is from India, I graduated in reproductive and developmental zoology from Punjab Agricultural University. After that, I moved to Montreal and I did two postdocs, both pursuing reproductive and developmental toxicology and then I started working in pre-clinical contract research companies, commonly known as CROs. And from there I came into Novartis, and it's been a wonderful seven-year experience. >> Speaker 1: Fantastic, wonderful, what are some typical activities that perhaps define general day or week that you would have in your position?
>> Speaker 2: A typical week as a PCSPTM can broadly be divided into few buckets.
Majority of the work is done with a target team, which is a PCS specific subject matter expert team. Then there is continuous direction with the project team, which is a NIBR based team. Then there are trainings, there are some non-scientific other activities including participating in workshops, running workshops, and then some time to bring me up to speed on everything that's going on, taking a step back about the target team. So, within PCS, we have for every program that we support, and PCS supports all the programs within NIBR. And once they move into GDD, depending on the level of support they need, PCS is involved on a very broad level within the organization. So, target team is a group of subject matter experts which are dedicated to making sure that the safety assessment in the preclinical arena is being conducted the right way. And so, this team includes a PTM, an anatomic pathologist, a clinical pathologist, a targeting toxicologist, an investigative sciences toxicologist, and then we collaborate. We work very closely with the pharmacokinetic sciences project team members, and so the target team works very closely to design the experiments that we run to assess the safety of a given compound. Designing the experiments, executing them, reviewing the data, interpreting the data at different stages of the experiments, different stages of the program, that takes a big chunk of our time. And then depending on different stages where the programs are, there could be very heavy target team activity, there could be just some background email communication that's ongoing. Second big part is interactions with the project team, so as a project team member, the safety representative on the project teams, my job is to understand and contribute to the strategy. To ensure that the safety assessment preclinically is being done the right way so that we are developing the right clinical safety strategy to ensure safe drugs into the clinic. And so, again, depending on the phase of the program, it will involve different activities including a lot of stakeholder management, one on one discussions, smaller group meetings, larger group meetings, presenting to different boards, and then a smaller portion of the time is spent in trainings, workshops, reading.
Sometimes there are some findings that will require spending more time reading up, okay, why do we have this finding? Is it on target, can we understand if it's on target versus off target? What additional experiments do we need to run within PCS or in collaboration with given disease area? What can we do to understand this better and see whether this compound can move forward or not? So, those are one of the most exciting parts for me in preclinical safety is you don't know what's waiting for you in your mailbox when you are logging [LAUGH] first thing in the morning, there can be surprises. And those surprises most of the times are exciting to resolve because it requires more work, reading up, understanding, interaction with some very smart people. So, lots of uncertainties that we work with every single day, but that's what makes work a lot of fun. >> Speaker 1: That's great, can you talk about some of what you would consider to be your essential skills in your position?
>> Speaker 2: Being able to communicate properly, ability to work with a variety of people because within PCS, as I mentioned, PCS supports all the programs within NIBR. So, we get to work with a variety of scientists within different disease areas, but that also comes with the challenge of having to work with different personalities and different teams. Every team has different dynamics, so you have to tailor your message to make sure that it's being received the right way, being in preclinical safety, one of the challenging parts of the job is to deliver the news that your compound is very toxic. These findings will not be acceptable for this patient population, we can't move this forward, so that's part of the job. That news has to be delivered, but different teams take the same message differently, and also as the safety expert, many teams expect me to explain to them, why did we see this? How else could we have designed this experiment to get all the necessary information and also find a safe dose that would help us move forward? So, making sure that I understand the team dynamics, making sure that I am setting the expectations from the very beginning and then meeting those expectations, understanding the science, understanding the strategy, communication, those are some of the skills that get me through every day. >> Speaker 1: It sounds like you provide other people with surprises in their email inboxes as well. >> Speaker 2: [LAUGH] I do, I try to talk to people rather than surprising everybody, if I can inform the PTLs, it helps manage the message differently than somebody suddenly finding out there's this challenge. And we currently don't see a way to move forward, which to be honest, is the reason we do preclinical safety assessment. We want to find all the liabilities preclinically and then see whether, what's the translatability? Is this a challenge that we can afford to have in the clinic? Is this finding really relevant to the clinical population or not? So, lots of factors that need to be considered, to be discussed and to be explained sometimes to the project teams, okay, we have this finding, but this may really not be translatable into the clinic. Or to the clinical population, this really doesn't matter because this is an animal species specific finding versus, we have this finding and I'm sorry, we can't take this compound forward. Honestly, it really varies from team to team for how they will take the message, I recently had a program where we had some surprise findings in one species and not the other. So, now we have a question to answer, is this just this species specific? What's the translatability? Why are we not seeing it in the other species, and it has impacted the timelines, but the team was very open in listening and understanding for why we need to do additional work. The challenges sometimes there are just target related challenges that you can't overcome no matter how many different compounds you try. And so, I can see from the project team members viewpoint, I have been working on this for so long, and now you're coming in and you're telling me this can't work. And we want to make sure that we have exhausted all the avenues before we give up on a program. >> Speaker 1: At the same workshop they did, and it was mostly organic chemists, people who had a chemistry background, didn't know medicinal chemistry, but knew how to make molecules. And they said, you chemists like to fall in love with your structures. >> [LAUGH] yes. >> because you know how to make them, and the chemistry works, but when the biologist tells you this is a dead series, you have to let it go and find a series that does work. And so, people do fall in love with certain, we lose sight of the big picture, it happens. >> Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, I remember in high school, there was a statement in the first chapter of the biology book, biology is a science of exceptions. And so, I still remind myself that, yeah, given the attrition rate in drug development, I have to frequently remind myself, and I've been working on a program, on a compound for some time, and then we get this data, and yes, I'm delivering the news, but at the same time, I have to remind myself, there's a reason we do these studies. And yeah, we might think we understand biology, but we need to do a bit more, we need to understand a bit more, if there's a difference in different aspects of this, just this given pathway, so we need to understand more. And yeah, it's all part of drug development, it's not an easy field, but it's fun. >> Speaker 1: Great, could you share anything about your current work at Novartis? How your work engages you or the benefit it will bring to patients?
>> Speaker 2: Yes, so I am currently involved in a few disease areas and programs supporting neuroscience and ophthalmology, and in a couple of programs within DAX, which we call a number of disease area x, which is broadly divided into benign hematology, NASH and renal indications. So, quite a variety of programs which provides insights into different strategies that we consider for different patient populations, different safety findings that can be tolerated for one patient population and those will not be acceptable for other patient population. So, quite a variety that I am engaged in, and, sorry, go ahead. >> Speaker 1: From CNS to the metabolic disorders to, it's a range. >> Speaker 2: Yes. >> Speaker 1: So, what are some of the challenges that you face in PCS and maybe hope that can be overcome someday? >> Speaker 2: [LAUGH] If I were to pick one or to categorize, I think one of the biggest challenges that we see or we face on a routine basis, is the translatability between preclinical species and into the clinic. For some targets, for some indications, preclinical species that we use, provide very good scenario of what could we see in the clinic. But there are challenges with certain targets where we may not have the right animal model or there might be challenges in selecting the right species to assess the appropriate safety markers that we can then monitor in the clinic. So, within PCS, we routinely discuss how do we overcome this, what are the tools? Can we look back at some of the clinical and preclinical data in this indication and what type of translatability do we see and what can we utilize from there?
Variety of tools and opportunities that we discuss to improve the translatability of preclinical safety assessment into the clinic so that we are going with a very robust plan into the clinic so the patients can benefit more.
>> Speaker 1: Fantastic, Sukhdeep, thank you so much for being available for this interview and sharing your thoughts and experiences with the participants in the course. >> Speaker 2: It is my pleasure, thank you for the opportunity. >> Speaker 1: Great, thank you.
