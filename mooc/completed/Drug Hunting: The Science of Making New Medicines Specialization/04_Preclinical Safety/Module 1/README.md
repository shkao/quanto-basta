# Module 1

## Interview with Sukhdeep Sahambi, PCS

## Introduction to Toxicology

### Learning objectives

- Define toxicology
- Differentiate toxicology & pharmacology
- Describe the importance of toxicology in drug hunting

### Paracelsus, father of toxicology

- **Paracelsus**, 1493-1541
- Famous quote (Latin): *"Sola dosis facit venenum."*
- Famous quote (English): *"Only the dose makes the poison."*

### Drugs: Both safe and unsafe?

- **Drug safety risks are evaluated relative to the benefits of treating the disease.**
  
- **Exceeding approved doses or using a drug for unapproved indications can lead to additional safety risks.**

### Toxicology and pharmacology

#### Toxicology

- Study of poisons
- Focus on safety risks
- Both on-target and off-target effects
- Focus of preclinical safety

#### Pharmacology

- Focus on therapeutic benefits
- Emphasize on-target effects
- Sometimes the term "non-clinical" is preferred over "pre-clinical"

## Lessons Learned in Drug Safety

### Elixir Sulfanilamide

- Oral antibacterial for children
- Sweetened with diethylene glycol (DEG)
- Distributed in September 1937
- Toxicity of DEG not generally known
- Over 100 deaths
- Led to 1938 Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act

### Thalidomide

- Treatment for anxiety, insomnia, and nausea
- Marketed in Europe in 1957
- Often prescribed to pregnant patients experiencing "morning sickness"
- Linked to deformities in over 10,000 children
- Found to impair fetal development (phocomelia)

### Regulatory changes

- Few cases in the United States
- Thalidomide approval blocked by Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey
- Insufficient safety testing of thalidomide
- Global increase in preclinical safety testing of new drug candidates

### Terfenadine (某種抗組織胺)

- Antihistamine for treating allergy symptoms in 1980s
- Fatal arrhythmias observed in isolated patients by 1990
- Risks linked to patients also taking antibiotics or antifungal agents

### Terfenadine metabolism

- Terfenadine is a **hERG** channel blocker.
- **hERG** = human ether-a-go-go receptor gene
- hERG encodes the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac IKr potassium channel.

## Preclinical Safety Testing

### Learning objectives

- Describe the stages of drug discovery and development
- List representative preclinical safety tests
- Outline the oversight roles of regulatory agencies

### Discovery & development overview

- Discovery
- IND/CAT
- Phase 1
- Phase 2
- Phase 3
- Launch

#### Screening process includes

- Screening
- Lead selection
- Lead optimization

### Later preclinical safety studies

- **Discovery:**
  - Target liabilities
  - Efficacy models
  - In silico safety
  - In vitro secondary pharmacology
  - Dose response
  - Phototoxicity
  - In vitro genotoxicity

- **Phase 1 and IND/CTA:**
  - Short term toxicology
  - Safety pharmacology
  - Safe start dose

- **Phase 2 and Full Development:**
  - Chronic toxicology
  - Reproductive and developmental toxicology
  - Investigational studies
  - Juvenile toxicology

- **Phase 3 and NDA/MAA:**
  - Carcinogenicity
  - Pre/post-natal toxicology

### Regulatory guidance

- **Regulatory agencies** – determine approval
  - FDA – US Food & Drug Administration
  - EMA – European Medicines Agency

- **International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Human Use (ICH)** – develop guidelines

- **"Good practices" (GxP)** – quality control guidelines
  - GLP – Good Laboratory Practice
  - GMP – Good Manufacturing Practice
