# Module 3

## Preclinical Studies Supporting Human Clinical Trials

### Learning objectives

Detail studies that explore:

- Genetic toxicity
- General toxicology
- Safety pharmacology
- Phototoxicity

### Genetic toxicology

- Mutagenic compounds cause mutations in DNA
- **Ames test** assesses a molecule’s mutagenicity in bacteria
- Additional testing required for advanced programs

### General toxicology

- Supports conduct and design of clinical trials
- Typically requires 1 rodent and 1 non-rodent species
- Studies include:
  - Repeat dosing & a range of dose levels
  - Common ranges: none (control), low, mid, & high
- Monitors key organ function
- Additional tests for biologics

### Duration of GLP toxicology studies

#### General medicine

- **Duration of Human Dosing**:
  - 1 – 6 months: Equivalent time period or longer in rodent & non-rodent
  - > 6 months: 6 month dosing in rodent, 9 month dosing in non-rodent

#### Oncology

- 4 week GLP toxicology dosing covers Phases I and II
- 13 week GLP toxicology dosing required before Phase III start

### Safety pharmacology

- Focuses on acute, life-threatening risks on key organ systems:

  **Cardiovascular** (dogs, NHP - non-human primates):
  - BP & heart rate
  - ECG
  - hERG (Ikr) assay
  - Repolarization (APD) & conduction (infrequent)

  **CNS** (rats):
  - Motor activity
  - Behavior
  - Coordination
  - Sensory/motor reflexes
  - Body temperature

  **Respiratory** (rats):
  - Respiration rate
  - Tidal volume
  - O₂ saturation

### Phototoxicity

- Phototoxicity can arise if:
  - Molecule absorbs UV light
  - Molecule distributes into the skin & binds melanin
- Phototoxicity increases the incidence/severity of reactions to sunlight.
- Can be tested through **in vitro** assays.

## Safety Considerations for Selecting a Human Dose

### Learning objectives

- List safety factors for initial human dose selection
- Define terminology associated with early dose selection

### Dose ranges (Phase I)

- **Maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD)** based on preclinical safety data (lowest in the dose range)
- **Predicted human efficacious dose** based on pharmacology data (midpoint in the dose range)
- **Maximum dose** based on preclinical safety data (highest in the dose range)

### Determining MRSD

- **MRSD** = maximum recommended starting dose
- **MRSD** is determined from the **No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL)**
- **NOAEL** = highest dose that does not cause adverse effects in preclinical toxicology studies
- **NOAEL** helps determine the maximum human dose (also referred to as the exposure cap)

### Oncology trials

- First-in-human trials for oncology drugs involve patients.
- Molecules for cancer indications often carry significant safety risks.
- **MRSD** for oncology drugs is designed to demonstrate efficacy.
- Oncology trials typically do not have a pre-determined exposure cap.

## Toxicology in Phases II and III

### Learning objectives

- List & describe pre-clinical toxicology studies for late clinical stage drug candidates

### Later preclinical safety studies

- **Discovery phase**:
  - Target liabilities
  - Efficacy models
  - *In silico* safety
  - *In vitro* secondary pharmacology
  - Dose response
  - Phototoxicity
  - *In vitro* genotoxicity

- **Phase 1** (IND/CTA):
  - Short-term toxicology
  - Safety pharmacology
  - Safe start dose

- **Phase 2** (Full development):
  - Chronic toxicology
  - Reproductive & developmental toxicology
  - Investigational studies
  - Juvenile toxicology

- **Phase 3** (NDA/MAA):
  - Carcinogenicity
  - Pre/post-natal toxicology

### Treatment Duration & Toxicology

| Duration of Indicated Treatment  | Recommended Duration of GLP Toxicology Studies  |            |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------|
|                                  | Rodent                                          | Non-rodent |
| Up to 2 weeks                    | 1 month                                         | 1 month    |
| >2 weeks to 1 month              | 3 months                                        | 3 months   |
| >1 month to 3 months             | 6 months                                        | 6 months   |
| >3 months                        | 6 months                                        | 9 months   |

### Reproductive & Embryonic Toxicity

|                                  | Description                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fertility**                    | • Drug administered prior to & during mating as well as up to embryo implantation    |
| **Embryo-fetal development**     | • Pregnant animals receive drug from implantation to hard palate closure             |
|                                  | • Fetuses evaluated for abnormalities                                                |
| **Pre- & post-natal development**| • Pregnant animals receive drug from implantation through gestation & lactation      |
|                                  | • Offspring monitored for health                                                     |

### Carcinogenicity

- Normally involves rodents (rat & mouse)
- Typically 2-year duration in rats
- Only required for chronically administered molecules
