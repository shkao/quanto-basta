By the end of this video, you'll be able to outline the process of finding molecules with promising activity. You will also be able to list some types of assays used to test molecules. Finally, you will be able to describe the role of molecular libraries in the early stages of drug hunting. For our discussion, an assay is any test that gathers information on a molecule's activity. In this video, we are focusing on laboratory tests in the early stages of a drug program with an emphasis on finding molecules that affect a target protein of interest. Because drug programs often explore novel targets, drug-hunting teams must often create new assays to test the activity of molecules. Let's focus on two common types of assays, binding and functional assays. Binding assays measure how well a molecule binds to its target protein. These assays can involve just the molecule and target protein, as in a biochemical assay, or the assay could be performed using whole cells. Binding a target, however, does not necessarily lead to a biological effect. Functional assays, which may or may not include cells, probe whether the molecule affects biological pathways or modulates target activity. Modulation includes activation and inhibition of function. Monitoring pathways often requires a cell-based assay, for example, a bio-chemical functional assay might test for enzyme inhibition. The desired molecule would inhibit the observed rate of a catalyzed reaction. A cellular functional assay might test whether a molecule affects gene expression or an ion channel. If a molecule shows both binding in a binding assay and affects target action through a functional assay, then the drug-hunting team is taking its first steps toward finding promising molecules. In some drug programs, the drug target may not be known. In these cases, assays typically monitor observable cellular functions rather than the activity of a specific pathway or target and do not require knowledge of either. These assays are called phenotypic assays. The early search for active molecules starts with a binding or simple functional assay that is used to test large numbers of molecules. This assay must be quick and amenable to automation through robotic technology. Such an assay is called a high-throughput screen, HTS, and is a key requirement for a screening campaign that enables the large-scale parallel testing of molecules. Here is a video of a robot, multiple robots actually performing an HTS assay, the arm moves microtiter plates to and from an incubator and onto a staging area. Another robot called a liquid handler dispenses reagents into the plate in which the assay is performed. In this case a 1536 well plate, the robot speed and precision allow HTS assays to be completed quickly while minimizing variability in the assay results. Molecular libraries for large drug companies can include well over a million molecules. A high-throughput screen may screen the entire library. The screening campaigns often focus on a smaller subset based on knowledge of the intended target. Specialized DNA-encoded libraries, DELs can have literally tens of millions of molecules or more. These libraries have their own technical hurdles that provide advantages such as finding active molecules against more challenging targets. Molecules with confirmed promising activity based on the assay results are called hits. A screening campaign may generate thousands of hits that will be evaluated for advancement in the drug program. Hits arising from target-based campaigns are typically further validated in biophysical assays designed to confirm and understand the binding of a compound to a target. Compound screening is a very dynamic branch of drug hunting that brings together Molecular biology, analytical chemistry, and robotics. Technological advances in any of these fields can introduce new tools to drug discovery. We have now learned how assays, high-throughput screens, and molecular libraries identify pools of molecules, hits with promising activity against the target protein. These hits now become starting points for a drug-hunting program.
