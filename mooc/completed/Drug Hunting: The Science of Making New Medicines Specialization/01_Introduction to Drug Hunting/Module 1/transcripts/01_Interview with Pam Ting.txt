It is my pleasure to introduce Pamela Ting. Pamela Ting is one of the staff scientists at Novartis, and so welcome Dr. Ting. I'm going to ask you some questions for this interview. The first question is, what is your current position with Novartis? Thanks so much Erland, it's great to be here. My current position is a research scientist at NIBR. I work with and I lead multidisciplinary teams, or big teams with experts in a lot of different fields, and we all come together with the same goal and that's to develop drugs to transform patient lives. Could you define NIBR for us, please? NIBR stands for the Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research. We're a group within Novartis, we're headquartered or based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but we have sites all over the world and we're primarily that biomedical research engine that drives early discovery for the broader Novartis. Fantastic, thank you for that. How did you get your current position? That's funny. It was an accident actually. Well, let's see. I have always loved science from the time that I was a little kid, all types of science. In school, I really gravitated towards biology, and I spent many years training in undergrad, in labs. I went to graduate school and postdoctoral training for biology. But what's funny is I never had a particular job or had career in mind. I really had no idea what types of jobs were available. I had wonderfully supportive parents that were very distressed that I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I didn't know anyone that did scientific research, and that's what I really loved, and so I ended up just spending a lot of time doing scientific research. Actually, what happened, how I got this position, was that I was working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, or GNF. It's a smaller Novartis site in Sunny San Diego. I was there doing my thing, enjoying my research, and then one day my mentor walked in and she said, I have a collaborator in Cambridge, in NIBR in Cambridge, and she's looking for someone just like you. Someone who has your expertise, someone who studies what you do to lead teams and lead a lab to do drug discovery, and she said, do you want to apply? I said, no. I never wanted to move. I never saw myself in that role. I thought about it. I ended up applying, I thought, I've never visited Boston, maybe I'll get a free trip to Boston. Long story short, I ended up with a job. I said, oh crap, well now I have to decide what I want to do, but I think hidden in there is maybe some small piece of advice to just find the best mentor as you possibly can, follow the learning opportunities. A lot of it comes down to luck. It just comes down to being in the right place at the right time, with the right skill set and knowing the right group of people. Luck and looking out for the right opportunities as well. I think so. Maybe that's saying, what is it that luck is what happens when preparation finds opportunity. Something like that. It's great. Now you've mentioned a little bit about your educational background with your postdoctoral research, could you talk about some of your other educational work that led to your position at Novartis? Absolutely. As I said, I was really interested in biology. As an undergrad, I majored in molecular and cell biology with an emphasis in immunology. I really spent a lot of time exploring different fields of biology. As an undergraduate, I worked in a research lab. I did computational chemistry and also neuroscience. That hands on experience was just the first time that I realized I really loved this. I really liked that concept of discovery. That you would venture into this huge unknown, and that using and harnessing your own skills, you would somehow logically define a path of experimentation to discover something new, and I really loved that. After my undergrad, I ended up going to graduate school. I got my PhD studying blood cancers, and then I did my postdoctoral fellow at GNF. I studied hematopoietic stem cell biology and genotyping. Fantastic. Could you talk about some of the day-to-day activities that you have as a drug discovery scientist? That's a great question. I would say most of my time is spent meeting with collaborators across the company. I would say about half of that is spent in the weed, with the data, with the technical science part of it. It might be thinking about how an experiment was done, or looking at the raw data, thinking about how we should analyze it, what does it mean, what are the caveats, how do we interpret it, and even what do we do next? I'd say about half my time is spent really knee deep in the data. The other half of my time is taking a little bit of a step back and taking this broader view and saying, okay, well now we have this piece of data. What do we do now? What does it mean? In those meetings I'm working with these more multidisciplinary teams where you might have many people looking at the same pieces of data and saying, okay, well this is how this might inform us. Can we make any decisions? Are there any gaps? What else do we need to know? I'd say that's the bulk of my time. On a week to week basis I do try to also carve out some time for me to learn. I like to attend some, we have a lot of internal seminars at Nib given by all of our scientists in different fields. I also like to meet new people and new collaborators there. For me, that's really time for me to learn and to learn from my colleagues what techniques are they using? What approach are they using to answer a question and then to reflect is that something that I can apply back to what I'm working on right now or with the two of us together, create a solution to a problem that we haven't solved yet. That's something that I like to do. Then when I can I still try to venture into the lab to do some bench science. I like to be there. It grounds me. I think that's really where all the action is. I don't spend as much time in the lab as I'd like, but I do find that when I work in lab, my hands smell like lab and I feel like a gardener. I've gotten to work in the soil of my discipline when we get to go. I love that and I love being the first person to see the data. Just watching it come up in real time and being like, wow, that's something we didn't know before. That's great. Now you mentioned working with teams. How big is a team? How big would a meeting be? Five people or 10 or 15? That's a great question. In meetings of all sizes. Every week I have regularly what we call one on ones. Just one on one, like this. It's often a time where you can have a more in depth discussion, maybe a more personalized discussion around what you're working on. We also have team meetings. We generally have a core for the team, which is maybe eight to 12 people that might be driving this strategy. Then we have broader teams. Some of those meetings might be to share information for people to learn. Those can range 40-100 plus people, all different types of teams that we work in. What are the skills that you bring to support other scientists when you're trying to tackle the problem? I think it's a question with many levels of answers I guess. I think one is that my role as a biologist. As a scientist, I'm there as a biologist, sometimes that means that I'm advising, based off of my knowledge of the disease biology. Sometimes that can be designing and carrying out a very specific experiment. Sometimes it can be there just to help the team or to help whoever it is define that key question. I would say that that's a primary role of mine is just to be there as a disease specialist or biologist. I think another way that I contribute to and support teams in my role as a team leader, part of my job is to basically remove obstacles and to create clarity. My job is really to do whatever I need to do and to make sure that the team has everything they need to be successful.
It's a really large multidisciplinary environment. Sometimes that means advocating for the team. Sometimes it can basically mean coordinating. Maybe we're organizing, maybe we're just trying to align on either a key message or a key set of experiments. It can be a lot of things. Then related to that, I think a big part of my role is also mentoring. Mentoring and coaching. At the end of the day, just making sure that everyone has that they need to be successful. That's great. That was a very nuanced answer. Related to that question that was a very nuanced response. Can you talk about choosing to work at a larger pharmaceutical company versus perhaps a smaller biotech, and some of those factors in your landing at Novartis? Absolutely. First, full discretion. I have never worked at a smaller company. I don't know. I do have friends that love it. I really can't comment on that beyond saying that biotechs do amazing work. Being small they can work very fast and they can take significant risks that really advance medicines quickly to patients. I can tell you a little bit about why I chose Nibs, a larger pharmaceutical company. Initially, it was really driven by the learning opportunity. I really wanted this opportunity where I could work on projects that were very early. Perhaps you're still looking for identifying a target. We call it target ID invalidation. But I also wanted to understand how do you then take that and translate that into a drug where we might be optimizing and trying to improve on certain properties, and then how do you take that all the way into the clinic? I really wanted that opportunity where I could have the freedom to both work on projects and also have exposure to projects that work on many different phases. I also liked the idea of understanding what goes on in other diseases. My own background is in hematology, but we can learn so much from understanding what might be going on in the liver for example, or maybe there are disease processes that might be similar in different organs. By working in a large company where we have many different types of expertise, sometimes you can exchange those learning and create that innovation. That's why I chose Novartis. Now, having been there for several years, I think all those things are true. I think an additional thing that I enjoy about it is just being able to leverage that breath and depth of scientific knowledge that I think really contributes to our ability to innovate new medicines. That's great. Could you share a little bit with us about what you're working on with Novartis and maybe some of the implications that would have for patients. I'm working on a sickle cell disease. For the past several years, I've been working on this hematological disorder. It's considered benign, but very severe. It's actually genetic, it's inherited. It's actually one of the earliest diseases that was characterized as a genetic disease. It's very prevalent in Sub Saharan Africa. There's actually quite a bit we know about the molecular basis and the genetic basis of the disease, but it's been neglected for a long time, at least from the drug discovery perspective. What we're working on is developing new therapies for sickle cell patients specifically those types of therapies that could be implemented in places like Sub Saharan Africa. I think that's really an effort to combine a very significant unmet medical need with advances that we have in different types of technologies. Gene therapy has been one that has been very high profile over the years, but being able to combine our resources with the need. I think for me, from my own perspective, part of really enjoying working in this space is, I feel like I can contribute with the skills that I have to a disease that really needs better medicines. As you mentioned, addressing unmet medical needs and the challenges for drug discovery. Can you talk about maybe some of the ideas that are particular challenges that may surprise people who are not directly involved in drug discovery themselves. That is a tough question because there are a lot of challenges. Drug discovery is hard. I think part of the experience is you're working in science. Science is mysterious, there are certain rules we don't understand, it's really a journey, there are soaring highs and devastating blows. You're trying to do something that nobody has ever done before. A long way of saying there are a lot of challenges to pick out one I think, I work in the pre-clinical research space. One of our biggest challenges is that a lot of the work we do is in cellular models. We use models in tissue culture and animals. But as good as they are, they're just models for a human disease that could be very complex. In some cases we don't even have good models. I think that's one big challenge that we have and if you continue to follow this line, even for the models that we do have, once you get into the clinic, you find that actually patients are very heterogeneous, they're very different. You and I are very different. Our models in the lab don't capture all of that to tackle that challenge that's something that Novartis, as well as many other players in fire tech and in academia have been tackling with big data. How do we better understand human patients, human disease? Can we find better targets that way? Can we design better clinical trials that way? That's just one example of showing how multifaceted those challenges can be and how much you need a team to tackle a challenge like that. There are a lot of those challenges. Hopefully some of the students on this course will want to join us in tackling those challenges because it takes a lot of different types of people. I'm sure they will. That was a great answer. Well, it has been my pleasure to speak with you for these few minutes and hear about your experiences and insights in working with Novartis and trying to address these unmet medical needs. Thank you, Dr. Ting and take care. Thanks. It's great to meet you as well.
