By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to list some examples of unmet medical needs. You will also be able to recognize the role of key scientific questions in framing a new drug program. What is an unmet medical need? An unmet medical need can include a disease for which no therapy exists, such as at the time of the recording of this video, Dengue. Unmet medical needs, however, are often more subtle, such as an existing therapy may have safety risks or be poorly tolerated causing some patients to avoid treatment. Or it may not be very effective or not effective in some patients. For example, patients with Alzheimer's have very few treatment options. Alzheimer's disease is an unmet medical need. For diabetes in contrast, many effective drugs, including insulin are known and established yet there still is no cure for this disease. Note that some unmet medical needs are not even about discovering a new drug. High blood pressure, hypertension has many effective therapies but many hypertensive individuals do not receive regular medical care and are unaware of their condition. Hypertension is often undiagnosed, unmet medical need is not only considered by pharmaceutical companies but also by patient advocacy groups, health care providers, government agencies as well as the World Health Organization. Remember that new drug hunting programs have a success rate of less than five per cent. The regulatory criteria for a new drug or for a molecule to be both safe and effective. Most molecules fail because of a safety issue or lack of efficacy. A more complete scientific understanding of the biological pathways of the disease can both minimize safety risks and enhance the efficacy of a new drug. Therefore, scientific study is a key factor for reducing the risk of failure and maximizing success. Scientific understanding, however, is rarely complete for any disease. Intuition, serendipity, and careful observation are also important factors for a successful drug program. Along with understanding the unmet medical need, an important way to maximize the chance of success for any drug program is to define the key scientific questions for that program. Representative key scientific questions, KSQ, for a new program focusing on an oral drug, maybe while modulating the target affect the disease outcome. Can the target be modulated by a drug? Can the drug candidate be administered orally? Are the known safety risks acceptable to patients? These criteria and others define the drug program and provide parameters to determine whether the drug hunting team is meeting its goals as molecules are advanced through the program. We are now familiar with the concept of unmet medical need and the importance of scientific knowledge to both define and guide the research program, maximizing the chance to success and minimizing risks.
