By the end of this video, you will be able to connect the ideas of pharmacokinetics PK to pharmacodynamics PD. You will be able to describe two PK/PD models. Finally, you will be able to relate PK/PD relationships from in vivo pharmacology studies in preclinical species to dose and dosing frequency predictions in human patients. Pharmacokinetics describes how the concentration of a drug in plasma changes over time. We have a CP time curve in the upper left. The CP time curve determines drug exposure. On the right, we have a curve that shows the effect of a molecule relative to its dose. When discussing in vivopharmacology, we showed how we measure efficacy in preclinical animal models and use biomarker changes to assess target engagement, in other words, PD. By combining these two data sets, we can determine how PK relates to target engagement and what degree of target engagement drives in vivo efficacy. This is called a PK/PD relationship. A key objective in lead optimization is to be able to understand the PK/PD relationship of a new therapeutic. Understanding a molecule's PK/PD helps determine how the molecule should be administered and at what doses during the clinical phase of a drug hunting program.
Unless the therapeutic target is in the blood, the plasma concentration may not represent the concentration at the site of action. However, it is often not possible to measure the concentration of compound at the target. So we have to relate the observed effect of the compound to what we can actually measure, which is CP. If there is a linear relationship between plasma concentration and the effect on a biomarker as measured over time, then we refer to a compound as having a direct effect. In other words, if CP increases, then the effect also increases accordingly. There are many drugs that behave in this manner. Two examples are labetalol and nifedipine, which are used to rapidly lower blood pressure. There are circumstances in which compound concentration does not relate directly to the effect on a biomarker. For example, there could be a distributional delay between the plasma and the site of action. Alternatively, the compound's mechanism of action may result in a sustained effect after the compound is no longer present in systemic circulation. For example, a compound may result in synthesis of a protein, and the protein may exist long after CP of the compound has decreased to low levels. In these situations, the CP time curve and response time follow an indirect or delayed effect model. An example of a drug that follows an indirect model is warfarin, which is used as an anticoagulant. The PK/PD of a compound is important to understand. A compound that follows the direct model must maintain sufficient exposure between dose administrations to show its therapeutic effect. A compound that follows the indirect model may show a therapeutic benefit without needing to be present systemically for the entire period between dose administrations. PK/PD studies the relationship between compound exposure and efficacy. Understanding this relationship is important for guiding lead optimization. And once the final clinical candidate is identified predicting a therapeutic human dose.
