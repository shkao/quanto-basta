By the end of this video, you'll be able to recognize why safety is so important to drug discovery and relevant to all investigational molecules and approved drugs. You will also be able to list some of the common reasons for toxic effects. Paracelsus was a Swiss physician who lived during the early 1500s. He is often recognized as the father of toxicology. One of his famous quotes is, the dose makes the poison. The implication of Paracelsus quote is that all substances, even beneficial drugs that meet medical needs, carry risks of toxicity. This may be surprising to some. Importantly, health authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration recognized all drugs carry safety risks while expecting those risks to be outweighed by the demonstrated benefits. Toxicity can be due to the drug's action on the intended target, which is called on-target toxicity. For example a molecule may target a protein in a pathway that reduces blood pressure. Reducing blood pressure somewhat has a benefit for an individual with hypertension. Reducing blood pressure too much is dangerous. The toxicity of such molecule is related to its mechanism of action and may also be described as exaggerated pharmacology or mechanism-based toxicity. In addition to on-target safety risks, toxicity can also arise from the off-target activity of a molecule. Perspective drugs are designed to bind a target, but they can also bind other targets and show poor target selectivity. Low target selectivity can lead to interference with other pathways and therefore safety risks. Drug metabolism forms new compounds, some of which may bind other targets and lead to toxic effects. Finally, the physicochemical properties of a drug may lead to toxicity, for example local tissue irritation. Two examples of commonly assessed safety risks early in a drug hunting program, are genetic toxicity and cardiotoxicity. One type of genetic toxicity risk is mutagenicity, which can be assessed through a bacterial mutagenicity assay, commonly referred to as an Ames assay, that looks for single base pair mutations. The potential for cardiotoxicity can be assessed by examining binding to the IKr potassium channel encoded by the human ether, a go-go receptor gene or hERG. The screens that test binding to or function of this channel are often called hERG assays. hERG active molecules can cause arrhythmias and lead to patient death. Screen for both mutagenicity and cardiotoxicity can be performed through in vitro tests. Besides these in vitro tests, health authorities require additional in vivo studies be performed. Toxicology studies of days to months in duration are conducted to examine the short-term and long-term toxicity risks in animal models and correlate those risks to dose and exposure. This includes the measurement of safety bio-markers such as liver enzymes to detect functional signals of toxicity in specific organs and tissues, and histopathological examinations. Safety pharmacology studies, which determine whether the compound affects the function of major organ systems, such as the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems are also performed. The potential for a drug to adversely affect behavior, reproductive function, embryo fetal development, and long-term carcinogenicity risks are also assessed in vivo. Finally, it should be noted that in silico methods for predictive toxicology are increasingly being used to complement both in vivo and in vitro studies. The outcome of these toxicology and safety studies, along with PKPD data, guides dose selection for future clinical trials. Drug safety is continuously a top concern for drug discovery. All molecules are potentially toxic and drug hunting teams study molecules through in vitro, in vivo, and silico methods to identify and understand any potential safety risks as early as possible.
