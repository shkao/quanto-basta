By the end of this video, you will be able to define competitive intelligence, CI. You will be able to list different types of CI. Finally, you will be able to describe some common sources for gathering information. Competitive intelligence, or CI, is the ethical process by which an organization learns about its competitive environment to improve the performance and strategic decision-making by the organization. Competitive intelligence involves both data collection and data analysis. Good CI involves the systematic collection and analysis of information from many sources. Gathered intelligence should be usable and actionable. Competitive intelligence, therefore, focuses on the identification of future trends and associated opportunities and risks before they become obvious. Competitive intelligence consists of two pillars primary and secondary intelligence. Primary intelligence refers to the collection and analysis of information that cannot be found in the public domain. Primary intelligence is therefore obtained through conversations with individuals. For example, networking with industry experts or key opinion leaders at trade shows and conferences, or talking to competitor customers, suppliers, and even employees. Secondary intelligence refers to information in the public domain. Online subscription databases and news aggregation sources have simplified the secondary source collection process enormously. Indeed, information technology tools allow data to be pulled into a central platform for more efficient analysis and dissemination. Gathered information must be validated through multiple sources to separate facts from rumors and gossip. The collection of secondary intelligence is vital to support primary intelligence gathering. Through competitor analysis and the study of sales data, financial reports, clinical trial information, and news articles, primary intelligence can be better interpreted for a fuller understanding of the competitive landscape. Of course, organizations are aware that their proprietary information may be sought by competitors. For this reason, employees are instructed in best practices for proper handling and transmitting sensitive information, being aware of one's surroundings, and not disclosing useful information. What type of individuals serve as sources of primary CI? Vendors who work with multiple companies and can often be met at trade shows. Similarly, consultants, financial analysts, and members of the press often interact with a large network of individuals who share worthwhile information. Academic scientists may be aware of relevant research that has yet to be published. Healthcare professionals may have insight into clinical outcomes that have not yet been disseminated. Regulatory officials can have advance information on clinical studies or regulatory changes. Employees of competitors may also inadvertently disclose valuable information about their work. In short, all of these individuals can provide primary competitive intelligence that may assist the strategic planning of a company. A very important point is that competitive intelligence is a legal and ethical business practice. Activities such as misrepresentation of oneself, bribery, electronic surveillance, and disclosing confidential business documents are all aspects of industrial espionage, which is both illegal and not part of ethically obtained competitive intelligence. We have now discussed what competitive intelligence is and importantly is not. We have listed two types of competitive intelligence primary and secondary. Finally, we have also reviewed some of the common sources used in gathering competitive information.
