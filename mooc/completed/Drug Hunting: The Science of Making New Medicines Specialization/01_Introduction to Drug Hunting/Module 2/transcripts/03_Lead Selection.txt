By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to list some key properties of promising hits. You will be able to recognize how hits evolve into leads. Finally, you will be able to outline the idea of structure activity relationships, or SAR, and how it contributes to optimizing molecules. A screening campaign of a library of over a million molecules can generate a pool of many thousands of confirmed hits. These hits need to be validated, which could include confirming the chemical structure of the compound, re-synthesized in the compound, and confirming its activity, and demonstrating a concentration-response relationship. Since screening is often performed at a single concentration, the number of validated hits can still be quite large and a drug hunting team cannot commit to intense simultaneous exploration of all of them. Therefore, these compounds must be filtered to find the most promising ones. How do we do that? First, consider that these hits were likely identified by their potency in a binding or simple functional assay. For a molecule to treat a disease, it ideally will show potency and other desirable characteristics like selectivity, reasonable physical, chemical, and pharmacokinetic properties, and low safety risk. These additional criteria assessed experimentally and from historical data on the compounds are used to filter molecules in the hip pool. Note that the advanced hits do not need to be perfect. We're just removing hits that seemed to have serious concerns or selecting the most optimal ones. Now we're down to a much smaller number of very promising hits. What is next? Assume the two molecules on the screen are among the most promising validated hits. In this case, they are directed against a G Protein-coupled receptor or GPCR. Chemists now begin to make modifications to these structures. The new structures are called analogs of the original hit. This slide shows two structures of each hit, but in practice, many more structures will be synthesized. Each analog is tested for desirable characteristics, for example, potency on the intended target, GPCR X selectivity measured as an activity on a potential unintended target. GPCR A, in this case, physicochemical properties shown here as lipophilicity, etc. Through these new structures and their activities, a drug hunting team begins to understand room for potential improvement in each hit. Each hit is now actually a hit series with modifications around a core scaffold. Scaffolds are often defined based on rings and their connections with the structure through analyzing how the function of each series is affected through structural changes, so-called structure activity relationships, or SAR, scientists can further prioritize hits and hit series based on which series of molecules shows gains and characteristics such as physicochemical properties in vitro PK, efficacy, and potency. Here is our best hit series. The original hypothetical hit is on the left. Some analogs are shown on the rest of the slide. While these analogs were derived from the original hit, some of the analogs differ considerably. They may have new rings and even be considered a different scaffold. Almost certainly, some of the new analogs will have much better overall properties than the original hit. Analogs and related compounds represent a potential lead series for the campaign. Following this lead selection, the full attention of the drug hunting team will focus on making new analogs to realize further gains in the desired properties of the compounds. Other lead series are likely to be advanced in parallel, providing the drug hunting team multiple opportunities to develop a potential drug. A systematic evaluation of hits for their various properties, Potency, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety is an important step for selection of a lead series for further research.
