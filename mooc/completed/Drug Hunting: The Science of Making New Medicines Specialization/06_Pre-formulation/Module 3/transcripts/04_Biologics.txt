By the end of this video, you will be able to differentiate between factors that affect pre-formulation in small molecule drugs and biologics. You will also be able to list areas of consideration in pre-formulation that are particularly relevant for biologics. While both biologics and small molecule drugs share many pre-formulation considerations, there are important differences. On the one hand, characteristics such as polymorphism and physical form are not a concern for biologics. On the other challenges related to stability, excipient compatibility, drug loading, and sterilization are much more significant for biologics. Vaccines introduce additional complexity when adjuvants are included with specific excipients designed to promote an immune response. A couple of these considerations with only small quantities of the biologic being available for pre-formulation activities, one can appreciate the pre-formulation space for biologics can be exponentially more challenging than for small molecule drugs. Sterility is a key focus for biologics pre-formulation. Many sterilization techniques for small molecule drugs cannot be used for biologics. For example, heating will rapidly degrade most biologics. Therefore, all aspects of pre-formulation for biologics must be performed in a clean room environment, which adds logistical complexity and cost. Any accidental introduction of microbial or pathogenic contamination during production may affect the safety, efficacy or stability of the drug product and result in loss of the entire batch. Contaminations during biologic manufacturer can be extremely costly. Sterility must also be maintained during packaging, transportation and use of the formulated drug. Excipients play a key role in biologics pre-formulation. Excipients ensure the stability of the drug during manufacturing, transit, storage, and in-use including the drugs, three-dimensional stability, which is critical to the safety and efficacy of the biologic. An unstable formulation is at risk of losing on-target activity or becoming toxic. Excipients also often enhance the biologics solubility, and especially key property if high drug loading is required in the face of the limited injection volumes, patients will tolerate. Other benefits include preventing aggregation, which can affect syringe ability of the drug, and controlling the pH and tonicity of the formulation to minimize infusion or injection site irritation. Finally, excipients can include preservatives or anti-oxidants to improve chemical stability and prevent microbial growth. Once prepared, a pre-formulation must be stable for transport, storage, and in-use by the patient. Common questions for consideration include, what temperature is required for shipment and storage? Can excursions from the ideal temperature be tolerated? Can the formulation withstand freeze-thaw cycles without losing safety or efficacy? How long can the formulation be left at room temperature for in-use administration to patients? Can multiple doses be delivered from one vial or are single use syringes preferred for the patient or care provider? The recent COVID-19 pandemic required vaccine developers to answer exactly these questions and others to ensure that manufactured vaccine formulation could be delivered as a safe and effective drug. We have now covered some of the key factors that differentiate the pre-formulation of biologics from small molecule drugs. The most important of these include stability, excipients, and sterility.
