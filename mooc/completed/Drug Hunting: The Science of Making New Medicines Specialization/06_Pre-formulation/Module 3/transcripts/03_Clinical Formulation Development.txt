By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to list goals for development of a phase 1 formulation, as well as list additional factors that affect early clinical formulations. Let's review some aspects of phase 1 clinical trials. Generally, the focus for the trial is evaluation of the safety, tolerability and PK of a drug. Typically, in healthy volunteers, the drug is evaluated over a range of doses that will help inform later clinical studies. If the drug is tested in patients, as in oncology trials, for example, there's also the possibility to collect information on the drug's efficacy. Let's now see how formulation development relates to these ideas. Development of a clinical formulation begins with an understanding of the disease or diseases the drug is intended to treat and the patient population. The clinical protocol defines whether patients or healthy volunteers will participate in the phase 1 trial and specifies other factors to be considered, including special requirements for dosing, such as in a clinical or in an outpatient setting and other therapies for the disease and their formulation. In addition, what route of administration would be preferable to the subject and the clinician evaluating the drug. For example, perhaps the patient population is pediatric and we need to consider formulations which can easily be administered to children. Has the disease modified the patient's physiology? Do we need to take this into account in formulation design? An example of this may be a patient who now has trouble swallowing due to complications from their disease. A solid dosage form pill may not be the best formulation option for this patient. Is the patient on any other medications, we may need to design a formulation that is compatible with the drug. Also, not cause any changes in absorption of other co-administered drugs. Predictions on the amount of drug required for phase 1 studies are another important consideration. Small-scale trials may only require the formulation be prepared on-site by a pharmacist, whereas manufacturing and logistics will be of key focus in the case of larger trials, the selective formulation must also satisfy many different criteria. Examples include maximizing drug delivery to the target, as well as being able to accommodate a range of dosages. The excipients selected for formulation should be generally regarded as safe or grass so that the formulation does not introduce new safety risks. Finally, the formulation must provide consistent absorption of the drug in order to reduce variability across subjects in the trial. A formulation that does not provide consistent drug exposure across doses and the clinical subjects may result in a clinical trial that needs to be repeated. Let's close by discussing potential risks that may have a negative impact on the outcomes of a phase 1 study. Consumption of food with an oral drug dose may decrease or increase absorption of a drug. Changes in exposure may impact the safety or efficacy of the drug. The formulator can often modify the formulation to prevent negative impacts from food. Similarly, co-administered drugs or their excipients may affect the absorption of the drug being investigated and possibly change its safety or efficacy profile. The formulation needs to be palatable. For oral drugs, the drug itself maybe bidder and its tastes may need to be masked, perhaps with a coating on the tablet. For parenteral drugs, the tolerability of the injection must be considered. Some excipients can cause irritation at an injection site and require balancing factors such as pH to minimize burning sensation. The dosing regimen should be convenient for the subject. Related to tolerability, our drug loading, the size and number of pills that patient must take and dosing frequency. Formulation can reduce the size of a pill, for instance, or create an extended release form which requires less frequent dosing, a once per day regimen for oral drugs is often ideal. Additional factors include where and how the drug formulation will be manufactured, the stability of the formulation, and even the cost of the formulation process. All of these considerations must be managed in the development of a clinical formulation, and optimal formulation can ensure that data from phase 1 trials are as informative as possible and positioning the drug to advance into phase 2 trials. We have now listed both some goals for phase 1 formulation and many factors that must be accommodated when developing formulations for these early-stage clinical trials
