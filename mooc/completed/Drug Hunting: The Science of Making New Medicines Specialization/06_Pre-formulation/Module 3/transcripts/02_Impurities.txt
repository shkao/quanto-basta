By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to define the concept of drug impurity. You will also be able to list sources of drug impurities and describe allowed levels of impurities in drugs. An impurity is defined as any component found in either the drug substance or drug product, which is not the chemical entity defined as the drug substance, nor is it a formulation ingredient in the drug product. Therefore, impurities can arise from the drug substance, either from the raw materials used in the synthesis or as side products that are formed during the synthesis. Purifications cannot always completely remove impurities. Impurities can also arise from ingredients in the formulation, or from interactions between the formulation ingredients, and the drug substance during the drug product manufacturing process or storage. Impurities can be organic or inorganic in nature, volatile or non-volatile, and can be identified or unidentified in terms of chemical structure. Impurities must be reported if they make up greater than 0.05% of the drug substance,ams or drug product. Impurity must be identified if the amount is greater than 0.1%. Identification involves determining the impurities chemical structure. Impurities must be qualified if the amount is greater than 0.15%. Qualification of an impurity involves performing toxicology testing of the impurity. These threshold percentages are valid for drugs with a maximum dose of less than 2 grams per day. Impurities are generally considered safe as long as they are maintained below the qualification threshold of 0.15%. Impurities that are found to be genotoxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic through qualification testing, will be required to be maintained at a much lower threshold or not allowed at all in a formulation. Changing levels of drug impurities from storage or transport are a key concern for drug manufacturers and regulators. Each drug product has its own assays specification for determining activity. The general guidance is to maintain 90-110% of the drugs intended potency. Assays specifications must be maintained over time to ensure the drug remains efficacious while in the hands of the patients. During storage, volatile impurities may evaporate in hot climates or storage conditions like the bathroom to cause an increase in potency. Alternatively, degradation of the drug substance may cause a decrease in potency. Drug manufacturers study the shelf life for their drugs extensively in order to set specifications on the length and conditions of a drug storage before it falls outside the assay limit, and must be discarded or destroyed. If a drug is found to fall outside the assay limits faster than anticipated through this testing, a recall may be required to ensure patients no longer use a drug which has sub-optimal efficacy. Safety, and efficacy of a drug are profoundly impacted by the quality of the drug, and the control of that quality by the drug manufacturer. To gain drug approval, a drug manufacturer will have to provide proof to regulatory agencies that it can consistently provide a high-quality drug within a certain specification limit for a specified time, known as the shelf-life. Regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, EMA, and WHO have guidances on how to assess and establish quality of a drug product. In addition, the ICH International Conference on Harmonization, provides guidance on identification, characterization, and qualification of impurities. All these guidances have the same goal to provide the drug manufacturer a roadmap of what is required for approval of their drug. Establishing a drug safety and efficacy depends on demonstration of the quality of the drug. We have defined the concept of a drug impurity, we have identified types and risks of impurities and described limits for impurities. Understanding these impurities is critical for the reliable production of a safe and effective drug
