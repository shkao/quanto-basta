# Module 2

## Routes of Administration

### Learning objectives

- **List common routes of administration**
- **Describe how pre-formulation assists in route of administration selection**

### Routes of administration

- The **route of administration** is the manner in which a drug is administered to a patient.
- The route is selected primarily based on four factors:
  1. **Physicochemical properties** of the drug.
  2. The drug’s **site of action** in the body.
  3. The **rate and extent of absorption** of the drug via the chosen route.
  4. **Patient adherence and acceptance** of the route.

### Available Routes of Administration

- **Oral**
  - Sublingual
  - Buccal
- **Inhalation**
- **Local**
  - Dermal
  - Vaginal
  - Rectal
- **Parenteral**
  - Intravenous
  - Intramuscular
  - Subcutaneous
  - Intradermal
- **Nasal**
- **Ocular**
- **Ear**
- **And others...**

### Pre-formulation & Route of Administration

- The **physicochemical properties** must align with the selected route of administration.
- **Drug absorption** by the route of administration must achieve efficacy.
- **Drug formulation** must be stable.
- The formulation must be **acceptable to the patient**.

## Classification

### Learning objectives

- **Describe the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)**
- **List physicochemical properties that affect drug classification**

### Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)

- **Class I**: High solubility, high permeability
- **Class II**: Low solubility, high permeability
- **Class III**: High solubility, low permeability
- **Class IV**: Low solubility, low permeability

The BCS system classifies drugs based on their solubility and permeability to help predict absorption and bioavailability.

### Dissolution and the BCS

- **Drug dissolution** is the rate at which a drug formulation dissolves in aqueous media at:
  - pH 1 (fasted stomach)
  - pH 4.7 (fed stomach)
  - pH 6.8 (intestine)
  
- **Rapid dissolution** (more than 85% of the drug formulation dissolved within 15 minutes) is required for BCS Class I or Class III classification.

### Additional classification systems

- **BCS**: Biopharmaceutics Classification System
- **DCS**: Developability Classification System
- **ECCS**: Extended Clearance Classification System
- **BDDCS**: Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System

These systems are used to classify drugs based on various factors such as solubility, permeability, clearance, and developability.

## Crystallization

### Learning objectives

- **List different crystalline forms of drug substances**
- **Recognize the influence of crystalline forms on drug absorption**

### Crystals: Neutral drugs and drug salts

- **Crystalline form** can affect properties such as solubility, hygroscopicity, and ease of physical handling.
- Examples:
  - Imipramine hydrochloride (neutral drug)
  - Imipramine pamoate (drug salt)

Different crystalline forms can influence the stability and absorption of a drug, impacting its overall effectiveness.

### Crystals: Solvates and Cocrystals

- **Crystal lattice**: Regular arrangement of particles without gaps.
- **Lattice with gaps**: Some gaps are present within the crystal lattice.
- **Lattice with filled gaps**: Gaps within the lattice are filled with another substance.

#### Symbols

- **Blue triangle (solvent)**: Represents a solvent in a structure, known as a "solvate."
- **Blue triangle (other molecule)**: Represents another molecule in the structure, referred to as a "cocrystal."

#### Examples of molecules

- **Caffeine** (structure shown with molecular formula).
- **Nicotinamide** (structure shown with molecular formula).

### Crystals: Polymorphs

- **Polymorphs**: Different crystal structures formed by the same chemical substance. The diagram shows five distinct arrangements of a similar crystal lattice.

Each arrangement represents a different polymorph, illustrating how the same substance can pack in various ways to form crystals with different properties.

### Effect of Cocrystals on Absorption

- **Graph**: Shows the plasma concentration of API A (active pharmaceutical ingredient) over time, comparing the absorption of:
  - **API A alone** (square marker).
  - **4-Aminobenzoic Acid Cocrystal of API A** (triangle marker).
  - **Benzoic Acid Cocrystal of API A** (diamond marker).

  The Y-axis represents the plasma concentration of API A in µg/mL, and the X-axis represents time in hours. The graph indicates that cocrystals influence the absorption rate and concentration of API A in the body over time.

#### Cocrystals

- **Benzoic acid**: Chemical structure shown.
- **4-Aminobenzoic acid**: Chemical structure shown.

## Drug Substance Stability

### Learning Objectives

- **Objective 1**: List stability factors affecting a drug in the human body.
- **Objective 2**: List stability factors affecting a drug substance during manufacturing, testing, and storage.

### Stability of Drug Substance

- **Within the human body**: Depicted by an image of cells or molecules interacting inside the body, which represents the stability factors influencing a drug once it enters the biological environment.
  
- **During storage & testing**: Illustrated by an image of various colorful powders, symbolizing different drug substances in solid forms, highlighting the stability concerns related to drug substances during storage and testing phases.

### Stability in the Human Body

- **Hydrolysis**: Affects compounds like esters, lactones, amides, lactams, carbamates, and imides.
- **pH**: Influences drug stability, especially in low pH regions such as the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Enzymes**: Found mainly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and, less commonly, in the plasma, affecting drug stability.
- **Light**: Can impact the skin and influence drug degradation.
- **Temperature**: The human body's temperature of 37°C affects drug stability within the body.
