By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to list some representative examples of drug products. You will also be able to contrast different considerations required for preformulation during preclinical studies and formulation for clinical trials.
A drug product is the formulation of a drug into a dosage form, which can be administered to humans both to investigate safety and efficacy in the clinic, and ultimately, to treat a disease in patients. The drug substance, on the other hand, is the unformulated drug, also called the active pharmaceutical ingredient or API. Formulation of the drug substance into a drug product maximizes absorption of the drug by the body while maintaining stability required for manufacturing, storage, and transit of the drug. Formulations can take on a variety of embodiments depending on what is being formulated. For instance, low molecular weight drugs are often amenable to absorption by the body and may be administered through injection, topical application, and ingestion. Biologics are less easily absorbed and are often administered by injection into the body. Biologics may also be implanted into devices for controlled release directly into the body.
The first and most important step in preformulation is defining the drug substance. For instance, will it be a small molecule or biologic? Once this is established, a key consideration is, where in the body is the drug target located? For example, if the target is in an internal organ, an oral, inhaled, or injectable formulation may be required. Alternatively, if the target is in the skin, a topical ointment may be more appropriate. The next step is determination of the dose required to establish drug efficacy and safety in preclinical animal models. In vitro based efficacy models and early animal PK studies can provide guidance to the preformulation scientist on the range of doses required. Following establishment of the in vivo dosing requirements, the physicochemical properties of the drug substance are characterized. Finally, the animal species to be studied are considered as different. Animal species can have different formulation requirements. Keeping in mind these factors and more, a preformulation strategy can be elaborated. This strategy will identify liabilities such as insufficient solubility, stability, or purity, and identify excipients or other methods to address them. With the formulation developed, the drug needs to be manufactured. This includes scaling up production as manufacturing transitions from a laboratory scale to industrial methods, following GMP, or good manufacturing practice guidelines. The drug product must be considered in the context of the in vivo studies. In preclinical studies, the drug substance must be formulated to allow easy administration to an animal to establish the safety and efficacy of both the drug substance and the formulation excipients. For instance, while a patient can take a solid dosage form such as a pill, for animal studies, this would typically be made into a suspension or solution and administered with a feeding tube. In this case, the suspension for the animal study is a surrogate of the formulation intended for patients. In addition, excipients are chosen not to elicit toxicological responses in the animals in which they are studied. Multiple formulations may be required to support preclinical and clinical studies. The translation of preclinical to clinical formulations, considering not only the route of administration, but also factors such as anticipated dose ranges and manufacturing, can be a very complex process. The formulation space for clinical trials is more lenient. Much of this is due to the patient's ability to follow instructions to swallow a pill, use an inhaler to administer a dry powder, or drink water to assist dissolution of a formulation, which animals cannot do.
We have now seen a number of different examples of drug products which often differ based on their route of administration. We have also highlighted different formulations that may be required as a compound moves from preclinical to clinical studies.
