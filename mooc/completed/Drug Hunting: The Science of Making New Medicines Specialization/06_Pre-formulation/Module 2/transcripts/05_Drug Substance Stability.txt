By the end of this video, you will be able to list factors that affect the stability of the drug substance both in the human body and during manufacturing, testing, and storage. Stability is a measure of how much a drug, substance or drug product retains the same properties and characteristics over time with three respect to the date of manufacture. Changes in drug substance purity or crystallinity can be monitored over time to measure stability. Chemical or physical changes to a drug substance can greatly impact the safety and efficacy of a drug. Hence, understanding drug substance stability is critically important. A key question for any drug is whether the substance is stable inside the human body. Drugs that rapidly degrade into other substances, called degradants in the body will lose efficacy and may become toxic. The human body is an aqueous environment and drugs which are usually organic molecules can sometimes undergo hydrolytic reactions in water that can alter or destroy the drug substance. Functional groups found in drugs include esters, lactones amides, lactams, carbamates and imides, and all can undergo hydrolysis. PH environments in the body can vary and lead to drug substance degradation. In particular, lower PH regions, especially in the stomach, can lead to acid catalyzed hydrolysis reaction. Stability issues related to hydrolysis are often related to PH stability concerns. Enzymatic stability is another key consideration for drug design. Again, hydrolytic reactions are often of greatest concern. Lipases in the gastrointestinal track are highly effective at hydrolyzing esters, peptidases also pose a risk for hydrolyzing amides. A preformulation scientist may design a formulation that protects the drug from digestive enzymes or the route of administration may be changed to avoid completely the digestive enzymes. Esterases in the plasma can also break down a drug substance, although this may also represent an advantage for some drugs. If a drug is susceptible to degradation in the GI tract or perhaps poorly absorbed, it may be possible to design a prodrug free of these shortcomings. Once the prodrug reaches the plasma, esterases will then cleave it to release the active drug. Sunlight is another chemical stability hazard for a drug substance. Phototoxicity can result if a drug administered or that distributes to the skin either reacts with components of the skin or degrades to toxic molecules following exposure to the sun. Finally, thermal stability due to the elevated temperature of the human body can pose another stability risk. Stability of a drug substance outside the body is also vital. Compounds found to be unstable in light will require limited exposure to light during manufacturing, storage and analytical testing. The effects of elevated temperatures during synthesis, isolation, purification and storage must also be monitored. The surface PH of a drug substance can cause stability problems which can often be addressed through salting of the drug substance to change the surface PH and improve stability. Salting can also increase stability to light. Exposure to air can lead to oxidation, while humid conditions and the associated moisture can lead to hydrolysis. Moisture absorption can be minimized by selecting excipients, which are nonhygroscopic and or contain minimal amounts of water. The drug substance may need to be stored in sealed drums to minimize air and humidity exposure. Note, that PH, light and heat can all potentially affect the stereochemical configuration of a molecule. If the stereochemistry is affected, this change may be enough to render the drug inactive or even toxic. We have now listed many factors that affect stability of a drug substance both in the human body and during manufacturing, testing and storage. Of these factors, the two most important are PH and exposure to water.
