By the end of this video, you will be able to describe the biopharmaceutics classification system, or BCS, and its used to classify drugs, especially orally-administered drugs. You will also be able to list the physicochemical properties that are most relevant for BCS classification. Immediate-release orally-delivered drugs are classified by the biopharmaceutics classification system, or BCS. Regulatory agencies across the globe have adopted the BCS to compare the in vivo bioequivalents of different formulations that are developed for a drug as it moves from pre-clinical to clinical stages. The BCS is based on three measured properties: The first is solubility. Solubility is measured by dissolving a drug substance in aqueous media at body temperature at three different pH values: 1.0, 4.7, and 6.8. The second property is permeability. Permeability describes the rate at which the drug diffuses either passively or actively across cell membranes, a surrogate for intestinal absorption. The last property is dissolution, which is the rate at which the drug formulation dissolves. The BCS separates drugs into four categories based on solubility and permeability. A drug is highly soluble if the full drug dose can dissolve in aqueous media. Class I drugs have high solubility and high permeability. Class II drugs have low solubility and yet high permeability. Class III and IV drugs both have low permeability. Another key component of BCS classification is stability in the gastrointestinal tract. If greater than 10% drug degradation is observed over one hour in gastric fluid or three hour in intestinal fluid, the drug cannot be classed as highly permeable, and therefore, must be classed as either BCS III or IV. Dissolution experiments examine the rate at which a drug dissolves. Different pHs are tested to simulate different conditions in the GI tract. BCS classification are affected by a drug formulation's dissolution. For a compound to be classified as BCS I or III, at least 85% of a formulation must dissolve within 15 minutes. Dissolution tests allow rapid comparison of different formulations to determine whether one formulation performs differently from another. This can significantly simplify clinical studies. If two formulations have sufficiently similar dissolution profiles, a bioequivalent study with the two formulations in human may not be required. Other classification systems have been developed after the BCS. All aim to deliver similar understanding of a drug formulation's absorption properties. The developability classification system, or DCS, focuses on intestinal solubility with a more biomimetic simulated intestinal fluid. The DCS can provide more insight into the relationship between a formulation's solubility and the level dosed. The extended clearance classification system, or ECCS, replaces solubility with clearance mechanisms. Greater understanding of the predominant clearance pathway of a drug can lead to improved understanding of intestinal absorption and membrane permeability. Finally, the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system, or BDDCS replaces permeability with extent of metabolism. If a compound is extensively metabolized, then it must be highly absorbed in the body and the permeation must be high as well. The importance of solubility is the same for both BCS and BDDCS. All these tools are helpful in pre-formulation and somewhat complimentary to one another. Each provides additional insight for understanding oral absorption of a formulation. We have now described the biopharmaceutics classification system, as well as other related formulation classification systems. We have also listed the physicochemical properties that influence a formulation's classification
