By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to list different crystalline forms that drug substances often adopt. You will also be able to recognize how changes in crystalline structure can influence drug absorption. The crystalline form of a drug can influence a range of properties, including solubility, dissolution rate, chemical stability, and flow properties for manufacturing and processing. The crystalline form is very important and can often be changed through the formation of different salts. On the screen are two salts of imipramine, an antidepressant. Imipramine was initially formulated as it's hydrochloride salt, shown to the left, to provide a highly soluble form for immediate release. The less soluble pamoate salt shown to the right, was discovered later and found to be useful for a sustained release formulation. The reduced solubility of the pamoate salt provided a means of slowing the release of the drug in the GI tract and providing a prolonged therapeutic effect of imipramine. Creating a salt form of a crystalline material through reactions of the molecule with acids or bases is just one method used in pre-formulation to find a crystalline form with optimal physicochemical properties. Crystalline forms involve the packing of molecules into a repeated lattice, a network of stacked molecules. Some molecules stack together and have gaps in the network. These gaps can be large, even large enough to accommodate additional molecules into the crystal lattice. Inclusion of a molecule in the lattice changes the crystal structure as well as its properties. Crystals that include water molecules are called hydrates. Inclusion of a solvent molecule, such as methanol, gives rise to a solvate. The gaps can also be filled by other larger molecules that are intentionally added to the crystallization media. Such crystals are called cocrystals. Almost any molecule can be tested for inclusion in a cocrystal. Representative examples include caffeine and nicotinamide. Drugs formulated as cocrystals can have very different properties compared to the pure crystalline form. Changes to properties such as dissolution and stability are possible. Many drugs substances compact together into multiple lattices that form stable crystalline forms. The difference in lattice packing can be compared to the various repeating patterns with which bricks may be used to cover an area. Selected repeating brick patterns are on the screen. When different patterns are seen in molecules, they are called polymorphs. Polymorphism is the ability of a solid substance to have more than one crystalline form, more than one polymorph. Most drugs have more than one polymorph. Not all polymorphs are equally stable. The marketed form of a drug is often the most stable polymorphic form. Different polymorphs can have different properties including, solubility, density, and dissolution rate. Some polymorphs may present formulation challenges, such as having poor flow characteristics in formulation equipment, or making it difficult to form the drug into a tablet. Pre-formulation scientists therefore study each drug's polymorphism to ensure that desired polymorph can be consistently and reliably prepared. A focus for pre-formulation is to maximize drug absorption to establish safety and efficacy in pre-clinical models. If a crystalline drug does not have the required properties to support absorption, modifications to the crystalline form may be required. In the examples on the screen, we have log CP, time curves for three drug crystalline forms. All three contain the same drug substance, compound A. One formulation is A alone. The two others are cocrystals of A, one with benzoic acid and the other with four aminobenzoic acid. While the benzoic acid cocrystal failed to improve absorption, the four aminobenzoic acid cocrystal improved absorption five-fold. This substantial improvement allowed toxicology studies for molecule A, and revealed that the compound did not have a sufficiently favorable safety profile to move forward. It is always better to have these types of failures early in drug discovery as they are less costly and provide the drug hunting teams with beneficial information to modify the drug to improve any deficient properties. We have now listed some ways in which the crystalline form of a drug substance can be changed. We have also seen the dramatic effect different crystalline forms can have on properties such as drug absorption
