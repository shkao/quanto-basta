## Introduction

### Learning objectives

- **Define what formulation means**
- **Differentiate drug substance & drug product**
- **Outline the role of pre-formulation in drug discovery**

### What is a Formulation?

A **formulation** is a mixture containing a therapeutic compound that can be safely and reproducibly administered to animals or humans.

- Includes the therapeutic compound in a specific form (e.g., crystalline form or salt) — often called the **drug substance** or **API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient)**.
- Contains **excipients** (e.g., binders or solutions).
- **Drug substance** + **excipients** = **drug product**.
- Must be consistently and reproducibly deliverable to humans.

### Various Embodiments of Formulations

- **Pills**: Solid oral dosage forms.
- **Inhaler**: Aerosolized or inhaled medication.
- **Injectable**: Liquid medication delivered via injection.

### Pre-formulation Activities

Addresses the needs for pre-clinical and Phase I activities:

1. **Lead Optimization**  
   - Lead characterization from a formulation and/or manufacturing perspective, aligned with patient needs.

2. **Pre-Clinical Studies**  
   - Define the best possible formulation to support pre-clinical studies (PK/PD/Tox).

3. **Phase I**  
   - Define the best possible formulation to support clinical testing and establish safety and efficacy.

## Physicochemical Properties

### Learning objectives

- **Define physicochemical property**
- **List & describe selected physicochemical properties**

### What are physicochemical properties?

Physicochemical properties are physical and chemical properties of a substance. Examples include:

- **Molecular weight**
- **Melting point**
- **Density**
- **Solubility**
- **Lipophilicity**
- **Ionization**

### Solubility

- The **amount of drug (mass)** dissolved in a volume of fluid (mL).
- Solubility is measured in various **media**.
- Solubility affects absorption, purification, and excipient selection.

| **Media**                 | **Implication**                                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Biological fluids         | Drug absorption                                               |
| Organic solvents          | Crystallization & purification                                |
| Formulation excipients    | Drug delivery as a solution to the body (e.g., parenteral delivery via a vein) |

### Lipophilicity

- **"Fat-loving"** property of a molecule.
- Quantified as **log P** (P = octanol/water partition coefficient).
- **Higher log P → higher lipophilicity → lower water solubility**.
- Lipophilic molecules are less likely to dissolve in body fluids (e.g., intestinal fluid, tears, stomach fluid).
- **Food effect**: Lipophilic molecules may show variability in absorption when taken with food due to interaction with dietary fats.

### Ionization

- **Solubility vs. pH**: The graph shows the relationship between solubility and pH for a weak base with a pKₐ of 4. As the pH increases, solubility decreases.

- **Body fluid pH**:
  - Stomach acid: 1.9
  - Lysosomes: 4.5
  - Human skin: 5.5
  - Intestinal fluid: 6.5
  - Saliva: 7.0
  - Eye: 7.3
  - Blood: 7.4

Ionization plays a key role in solubility and absorption, as different pH levels in body fluids can impact the ionization state of a drug, affecting its solubility and bioavailability.

## Physicochemical Properties - Supplementary Information

- **Ionization and pH**:
  - Most drugs have acidic or basic functional groups.
  - Ionization depends on the pH of the surrounding environment (e.g., the **GI tract**).
  - Ionization influences key properties like **solubility** and **absorption rate**.

- **Acid-Base Equilibrium**:
  - Acidic drugs are neutral in their parent form but ionize after losing a proton.
  - The degree of ionization is dependent on **pKa** and the environment's pH.
  - **Ka** (acid ionization constant) is commonly expressed as **pKa** (-log Ka).

- **GI Tract pH**:
  - **Stomach pH** ~ 2.0.
  - **Duodenum pH** ~ 6.0.
  - **Ileum pH** ~ 7.5.
  - pH variations affect drug ionization states and absorption.

- **% Ionization Calculation**:
  - Equation:
    \[
    \% \text{ionization} = \frac{10^{\text{pH}-\text{pKa}}}{10^{\text{pH}-\text{pKa}} + 1} \times 100
    \]
  - Sample: Warfarin (pKa 5.0) in the duodenum (pH 6.0) shows **91% ionization**.
