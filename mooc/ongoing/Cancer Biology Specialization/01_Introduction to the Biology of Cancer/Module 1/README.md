#### Understanding Cancer: An Open Course Overview

- **Global Cancer Impact**:
  - Over 500,000 deaths annually in the US, 8 million globally.
  - Rising incidence with age; projected 20 million cases per year by 2030.
  
- **Course Focus**:
  - Designed for those wanting to understand cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
  - Covers molecular biology (oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes) and cancer risk factors.
  
- **Key Lectures**:
  1. **Types of Cancer Worldwide**.
  2. **Genetic Contribution to Cancer**.
  3. **Ten Cellular Hallmarks of Cancer**.
  4. **Metastasis and its Major Steps**.
  5. **Imaging in Cancer Diagnosis & Treatment**.
  6. **Cancer Treatment Methods**.

- **Purpose**:
  - Gain a basic understanding of cancer biology, not a guide for treatment decisions.
