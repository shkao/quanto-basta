Welcome to Introduction to Cancer Biology. My name is Ken Pienta,
Professor of Urology and Oncology at the Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine. I have been studying cancer and treating
patients with cancer for over 25 years. Over 500,000 people in
the United States and over 8 million people worldwide
are dying from cancer every year. As people live longer, the incidence
of cancer is rising worldwide and this disease is expected to strike over
20 million people annually by 2030. Everyone has been or will be touched by
cancer in some way during their lifetime. Thanks to years of dedication and commitment to research we've made
enormous advances in the prevention and treatment of cancer, but
there is still a lot of work to be done. We've put together this course in order
to introduce you to the essentials of cancer research. By the time you finish this course, you'll be able to identify the major
types of cancer worldwide, including lung, colon, breast,
prostate, liver and stomach cancers. List and describe the hallmarks of cancer. You'll be able to differentiate
the contribution of genes to the risking growth of cancer. You'll be able to define metastasis and identify the major steps
in the metastatic process. You will also be able to describe
the role of imaging in the screening, diagnosis, staging and
treatment of cancer. And finally,
explain how cancer is treated. This introduction should be helpful to
anyone who wants to develop a basic understand of cancer biology and
treatment. It should be useful to undergraduate
students who are interested in an introduction to
the science of cancer. It should also be helpful to health
care providers, data managers and educators who wish to develop a better
understanding of cancer and how it affects individuals living in the US as well
as other countries around the world. The course is not designed for
patients seeking treatment guidance. But if you're interested in
a career in cancer research or patient care, we hope this course
will inspire you to pursue that path. Over the next few weeks, you'll be hearing
from me and several of my colleagues. We'll walk you through the fundamental
components of cancer biology research underway today. I'll start off by talking about
the incidents and etiology of cancer. Next, Dr. Sarah Aman will
cover the genetics of cancer. After that, we'll hear from Dr. Julian Zareef who will introduce
you to the hallmarks of cancer. And next, we'll learn about
metastasis from Dr. Ken Valkumberg. We'll then hear from Dianne Race in
imaging diagnosis and staging of cancer. And finally, you'll hear from me
again as I cover cancer treatment. I'm glad that you decided
to join this course. We hope that you will develop
a basic understanding of cancer. We hope that it will help you
in whatever field you work in. If you are a student, we hope that what
you learn here will help you begin a career in cancer biology research or
even patient care and contribute to worldwide
offer to save lives. Thank you very much.
