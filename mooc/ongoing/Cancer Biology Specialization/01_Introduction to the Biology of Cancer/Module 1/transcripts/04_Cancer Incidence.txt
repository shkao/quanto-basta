Now we are going to be talking
about cancer incidents or how often a cancer is diagnosed and how
often it kills people around the world. If you look at the leading causes
of death worldwide in 2012, and this is when the last statistics were
really available, you can see that heart disease continues to kill over 7
million people a year around the world. Followed closely by stroke as well as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Number five on this list is lung cancer,
killing about 1 and a half million people per year. This graph is somewhat misleading however, because if you really look at the number
of all cancers diagnosed globally, it's actually 14.1 million cancers
diagnosed in 2012, worldwide. Importantly, more than half of these,
8 million, occurred in Economically developing
countries around the world. And very significantly,
8.2 million people died of cancer in 2012, making it the number one
killer in the world overall. And the number one cause of death. The number of people expected to
be diagnosed 15 years from now, in 2030, is almost 22 million people. This is because as we actually
eradicate diseases like pneumonia and malnutrition, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and some of the diarrheal illnesses,
people are expected to live much longer. As they live longer,
more cancer will be diagnosed. So, in 2030, we expect almost 22
million people to be diagnosed and 13 million people to die of
cancer despite the advances we'll be talking about in treatment throughout
the course of later lectures. Overall, the most common cancers
worldwide are lung cancer, accounting for 13% of all cancers
diagnosed or 1.8 million people. Breast cancer is diagnosed in
1.7 million women per year, and account for
about 12% of all cancers diagnosed. Colon cancer, 10% of all cancer
is diagnosed, 1.4 million people. Prostate cancer, 1.1 million men get
diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. Stomach cancer, almost a million people
are diagnosed yearly with stomach cancer. And liver cancer, almost 800,000 people
are diagnosed with liver cancer. If you look at the causes of
death in the United States and here we have data from 2014. Heart disease and cancer remain
the number one and two killers by far, compared to all of the other illnesses
that afflict United States citizens. If you compare what kills people in
the US compared to around the world, you see a much lower incidents of respiratory
disease, stroke, and pneumonia. And certainly diseases
like malnutrition and diarrheal illnesses have been virtually
wiped out in the United States. As we continue to improve our
ability to treat heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension, it is expected that cancer will become the
number one killer in the United States. This ends our section
on incidents of cancer. We've basically reviewed cancer facts
around the globe as well as in the US. And in the next section,
we will talk about the common cancers.
