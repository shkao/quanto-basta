Welcome to the first lecture in our
Introduction to Cancer Biology course. This lecture will cover the incidence and
etiology of cancer. By the time you finish this lesson,
you'll be able to define cancer, understand where cancer starts,
identify the most common types of cancer, and identify the risk factors for
the common types of cancer. As you listen to this lecture, pay special
attention to understanding what cancer is and how it is a global health problem. The number of people affected by
cancer every year is staggering. And the problem of cancer is only growing.
