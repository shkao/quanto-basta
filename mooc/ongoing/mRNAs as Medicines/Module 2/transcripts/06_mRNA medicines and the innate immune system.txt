Welcome back. In the previous lesson, we learned about
lipid nanoparticles, or LMPs, and how they protect mRNA medicines from
premature degradation and deliver them into cells. But one last major hurdle
that had to be overcome to create effective mRNA medicines was the innate immune system. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. Now, when you hear the
words immune system, what probably comes to
mind are antibodies, which are proteins in
the bloodstream that recognize and neutralize
a particular pathogen. Antibodies are made by B cells, one of the key cell types that make up our adaptive
immune system. The adaptive immune
system is what vaccinations tap into
to protect us from getting sick or
severely ill from a specific pathogen
like SARs CoV 2. The other key cell type in the adaptive immune
system are T cells. A type of T cell called
cytotoxic T cells recognize and eliminate any cells in our body that have been
infected by a pathogen, thus preventing
those infected cells from making more
of that pathogen. While the adaptive immune
system enables us to develop very strong defenses against
specific infectious agents, it takes our bodies
weeks to months to develop a new adaptive
immune response and multiple days to gear
it back up to fight a pathogen that we've been exposed to in the distant past. Thus, the adaptive immune system is too slow to be suitable as a first line of defense when we encounter an entirely
new pathogen. This first line of defense is the job of the innate
immune system. Rather than recognizing
the unique features of a specific pathogen, the innate immune system
recognizes features common to all pathogens
of a specific type. For example, many bacteria
contain a substance called lipopolysaccharide or LPS
on their outer surfaces. Our innate immune system is always on the lookout
for any LPS in our body because this is one of the earliest warning signs
of a bacterial invasion. Recognition of LPS sets off inflammatory alarm
signals resulting in body aches and fever. Now, let's watch
a video to learn more about our innate
immune system sensors. A large number of
viruses that infect humans have instruction
sets in the form of RNA. Common examples are
coronaviruses, flu, and polio. These viruses enter cells
by endocytosis and then release their RNAs from the
endosomes into the cytoplasm. But this process is
not 100% efficient, meaning that some viral RNA gets released inside
the endosome. Our own mRNAs originate in the nucleus and stay
in the cytoplasm, so are not normally
found inside endosomes. R innate immune system has
special protein sensors that are constantly on the lookout
for RNA inside endosomes. When these sensors detect
RNA inside endosomes, the presumption is that
it must be dangerous. The RNA sensors set
off an alarm signal, and proteins called
interferons and cytokines are released causing local
inflammation and sometimes fever. Remember from the last
lesson that LMPs also use endocytosis to deliver
their mRNA cargoes into cells. Like viruses, release of LMP-encapsulated mRNAs
into the cytoplasm is not 100% efficient
with some fraction of the mRNA being released
inside the endosome. Thus, LMPs containing
mRNA can appear to our innate immune system to
be a potential RNA virus. To make effective
mRNA medicines, it was therefore
crucial to learn how to slip by the innate immune
sensors in the endosomes. The first step to
overcoming this hurdle was understanding exactly
what molecular features the sensors detect. Work published in the early
2000s demonstrated that the feature recognized by some sensors is the
RNA nucleotide U. When U binds to these sensors, the sensors get activated and start sending out
danger signals. Soon after that discovery, further research showed that using modified versions of U, as long as they
don't interfere with translation by the ribosome can prevent the sensors from
recognizing RNA in endosomes. It turns out that although ACG and U are the most
common RNA nucleotides, our cells also contain many
modified versions of these. In fact, over 100 different
modified nucleotides are known to exist in nature. One that is normally present
in the human body is 1-methyl-pseudouridine
or 1MY for short. If U is replaced with 1-methyl pseudo U as the nucleotide in the
transcription reaction, T seven RNA polymerase
will produce mRNA with 1-methyl
pseudo U throughout. These 1-methyl pseudo U
mRNAs are able to evade the innate immune sensors that search for viral
RNAs in endosomes. But even if an mRNA molecule
is able to avoid activating the innate immune
sensors that detect single-stranded RNA
inside endosomes, there is yet another
defense system to avoid. This second defense
system is on the lookout for long stretches of
double-stranded RNA. Like the sensors we've
already discussed, this second set of sensors evolved to protect
us from viruses. In order to make new
copies of themselves, all RNA viruses
have to go through a phase where their RNA
is double-stranded. This feature is not
present in our own, mRNAs, which are largely
single-stranded. Thus, a second set of
innate immune sensors patrols both endosomes
and the cytoplasm, looking for long stretches of perfectly base-paired
or double-stranded RNA. Again, when these
sensors are activated, they set off alarm
signals causing the release of interferons
and cytokines. Unfortunately, the
traditional process of transcribing mRNA using T seven RNA polymerase
also generates a small amount of
double-stranded RNA by-products. To make an effective
MRNA medicine, these double-stranded
RNA by-products need to be kept to a minimum. Fortunately, mRNA drug
makers have now found very efficient ways to decrease the amount of double-stranded
RNA by-products, both by changing the
transcription reaction conditions and by implementing strict
purification protocols. Understanding all the ways
the innate immune system detects potential invasion
by RNA viruses has enabled mRNA medicine makers to
find creative solutions to avoid setting off the
innate immune alarm systems. Combining these solutions with efficient mRNA delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles, has opened the door
to the development of many new mRNA medicines. The various ways we can use mRNA medicines will be the
topic of the next module.
