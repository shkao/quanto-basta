Welcome back. In the
last two lessons, we learned about the
properties of mRNA that make it possible to
be used as a medicine. Importantly, mRNA medicines
enable the human body to make its own medicinal
proteins by tapping into the natural process
of protein production. In this lesson, we'll learn
about the challenges that had to be overcome to
realize this potential. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. First, let's watch a video about how mRNA is made
outside the body. The first challenge
to overcome was making mRNA outside the body. Remember, in our bodies, mRNA is copied or transcribed from DNA in
the nucleus of our cells. Making mRNA medicines, however, requires a DNA template
outside of cells. This is accomplished
by inserting a specially coded piece
of DNA into bacteria, allowing these bacteria to reproduce and make many
more copies of that DNA, and then carefully isolating and purifying the amplified DNA. From here, the
process to synthesize mRNA molecules is purely
biochemical, that is cell-free. The DNA template
is first cut with special molecular
scissors to linearize it. This linear DNA is then
incubated with nucleotides and a special RNA polymerase
called T7 RNA polymerase. The polymerase strings
together the nucleotides in the correct order to
produce the mRNA. This reaction can
be carried out on many different scales from a very small amount
for research purposes, to enough for one patient
for a personalized medicine, to enough for tens or hundreds of patients to treat
a rare disease, or on an incredibly
large scale to make tens of millions of mRNA vaccine
doses in a single batch. Once the mRNA has been purified, it goes through multiple
quality control steps to ensure that the batch
no longer contains any DNA or any leftover
reaction materials and that the mRNA
itself is intact. Next comes formulation. Because our bodies impose multiple biological
barriers that prevent it from staying intact until it reaches
the target tissue, mRNA cannot be dosed as
a medicine on its own. It is not currently possible to take an mRNA medicine
by mouth because it will be seen as food and be immediately broken
down and recycled. Instead, most mRNA medicines are injected into
a muscle if it's a vaccine or intravenously that is IV if it's
a therapeutic. Other mRNA medicines are being developed
that goes straight to the nasal passages or
lungs through an inhaler, and still more are in development to be applied
directly to the skin. Within our own bodies, mRNA doesn't normally
exist outside of cells. When naked mRNA appears in the bloodstream or
lymphatic system, our bodies assume it's either
debris from dead cells or evidence of infection
by an RNA-based virus. Our biological fluids are
full of custodial proteins that clean up dead cells and defend us against
viral infections, and they rapidly
destroy naked RNA. Further, since mRNA is normally made within
the cells that need it, the molecule contains no way finders for where
in the body to go. Therefore, mRNA alone has no means for tissue
or cell selectivity. Finally, even if it was able to survive and find
the desired cells, it would have no way to cross the cell membrane to get inside. Remember that mRNAs are
highly negatively charged, so cannot easily
cross cell membranes. For all of these reasons, mRNA medicines require
a delivery vehicle, some sort of packaging
material that serves three purposes; first, to protect it from
degradation, second, to direct it to the desired
tissue and cell type, and third to help it gain
entry into the cell cytoplasm.
