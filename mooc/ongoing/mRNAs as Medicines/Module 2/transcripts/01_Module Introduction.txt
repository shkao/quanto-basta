Welcome to Module 2,
learning about medicines. In Module 1, we covered proteins and
mRNA's, their structures, how they're made, and
the roles they play in the body. In this module, we'll learn about what
properties make for a classic medicine, and how our options have expanded
with recent technological advances. So that we're now able to
rethink what a medicine can be. Specifically, we'll be addressing
the question, how can proteins and mRNA's be used as medicines?
