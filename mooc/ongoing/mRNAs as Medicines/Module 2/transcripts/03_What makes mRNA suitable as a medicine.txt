Welcome back. Before we learn about how mRNA can be
used as a medicine, let's talk about some of the properties
generally required of medicines so that we can have control over their effects
and ensure their safety. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. An ideal medicine has
three basic attributes. One, its effect is
dose-dependent. Two, its effect is time-limited. Three, it can be
dosed repeatedly. Both classic small molecule
and protein medicines have all three of
these properties. A limited duration of
effect is particularly important because if one
experiences side effects, you can simply stop
taking the medicine. Let's check to see whether mRNA has the right features
to be an ideal medicine. Unlike DNA, which serves as the permanent repository of
your genetic information, both proteins and mRNAs
are inherently transient. With very few exceptions, most proteins are
under constant flux. They have limited lifetimes and must be regularly replenished. Likewise, the instructions
for making them, the mRNAs are constantly
made and destroyed, only to be remade again. This enables your body to
rapidly change the amounts of key proteins so that you can respond to
changing conditions. To illustrate this, let's
consider your circadian clock. This is the timer
in your body that tells you when to be
active and when to rest. The proteins responsible for the clock are aptly
named clock proteins, and they appear
and disappear with astounding regularity
every 24 hours. Your body accomplishes this with a daily cycle of clock mRNA
creation and destruction. The amount of protein
produced at any one time is tightly tied to the amount of
mRNA present at that time. Over and over, for
every day of your life, your cells get their daily
dose of clock mRNAs, driving expression
of clock proteins. Although all proteins
and mRNAs are transient, each different protein and
its corresponding mRNA has been tuned evolutionarily to have an optimal lifetime. Now, let's learn about
a way to measure how long proteins and
mRNAs stick around. A common measure used
to describe how long a particular substance sticks
around is its half-life. Half-life is the amount
of time required for half of a substance to disappear
after it has been made. Structural proteins tend
to last the longest. The protein crystallin
in the lens of your eye has a half-life
of more than 70 years. Once incorporated into the lens, crystallin cannot
be replaced and needs to last you
your entire lifetime. But this is highly unusual. Antibodies are among the
longest lived proteins, but their half-lives
are only 10-21 days. Remember that huge
protein titin, its half-life is
just three days. Shorter still are
the half-lives of proteins that mediate
metabolic reactions. Remember that metabolic
chart from Module 1? An example from this class is the protein glucose
6-phosphatase, the one that's missing
in Von Gierke disease. Its half-life is somewhere
between 8 and 48 hours. At the very short end are signaling proteins like
the hormone relaxin, whose half-life is
less than 10 minutes. So protein half-lives can
span for minutes to decades. The median protein
half-life is estimated to be about 30 hours
or just over a day. So what about mRNAs? How long do they last? mRNAs are not nearly as
long-lived as proteins. The typical human mRNA has a half-life of just five hours. Of course, like proteins, mRNA half-lives do cover
a range with the shortest being just a few minutes and the longest being about five days. Importantly, no mRNA lasts
for your entire life. They are short-lived by design
so that your body can make the appropriate proteins in the appropriate amounts as
your body requires them. Because, one, mRNA is transient. Two, there is a dose dependency between an mRNA and the
protein it encodes. Three, an mRNA can be
induced over and over again. mRNA has all three properties
of a classic medicine. In addition to these, there are three more key
properties of mRNA that make it extremely attractive as a new way of
making medicines. We learned about the first of these in the previous lesson. That is, mRNA has the ability to direct the body to make
any type of protein, not just proteins that do
their job outside of cells. So mRNA medicines
have the potential to meet many currently
unmet medical needs. These range from
rapid development of vaccines against
new pathogens as quickly as they emerge to stimulating the immune
system to fight cancer, to treating patients with inborn metabolic
errors by giving them back the ability to make the protein
they're missing. The second feature is the small manufacturing
infrastructure requirements for making mRNA medicines. Unlike recombinant
proteins made by tissue culture cells grown
in huge bioreactors, the process of making
mRNA medicines has a much smaller
manufacturing footprint. mRNA medicines are made using solely chemical, biochemical, and biophysical processes that do not require
mammalian cell culture. The equipment for
these processes is relatively small
and can be mobile, making the manufacturing
facility highly adaptable. Because the infrastructure
and equipment required to make mRNA medicines
are relatively modest, manufacturing sites
can be easily set up in multiple
locations around the world. Because the sequence of
nucleotides that make up an mRNA is
simply information, when mRNA drug designers
have successfully created a new mRNA
medicine, say, a vaccine against a
rapidly emerging pathogen, that mRNA sequence can be
instantly delivered digitally to every manufacturing site for local synthesis
and distribution. In the future, as
technology improves, it might even be
possible to miniaturize the entire manufacturing
process to take place in a single
bench top machine. The third feature is that, unlike small molecules
and proteins, mRNA is an
information-containing molecule. It is not itself the
active medicine. mRNA is simply a
recipe that tells the body how to make its
own medicinal proteins. Once a drug maker knows
how to make and formulate clinical-grade mRNA and how to direct it to the desired
cell type, for example, immune cells for vaccines or liver cells for a metabolic
disorder therapeutic, they can simply swap out the
previous mRNA sequence with a new one to create a new mRNA
medicine of the same type, for example, a new vaccine
or a new therapeutic. mRNA medicines are therefore
a platform technology. According to techopedia.com, a platform is a group
of technologies that are used as a base upon
which other applications, processes, or technologies
are developed. These days, most of us have a platform technology in our
pockets: our smartphones. The phone's hardware
and operating system constitute the platform. This platform then enables
rapid development of countless apps that
we all use every day. In the case of mRNA medicines, the hardware is the
manufacturing equipment used to make the mRNA medicines. The operating system consists
of the processes and know-how for making mRNA
medicines at various scales. Importantly, all
mRNA medicines of a particular type use the same raw materials and
manufacturing processes. Thus, the need for
re-engineering to create a new
medicine is minimal, and this can greatly accelerate the timelines to
develop the apps. That is, the individual
mRNA medicines. Yet another advantage of mRNA medicines is that they
can be easily multiplexed, meaning that more than one mRNA can be delivered in
a single medicine. This can provide the
body with instructions to make multiple different
proteins at the same time. Remember that some proteins act as multi-protein complexes. If a particular application requires synthesis of
the entire complex, the mRNAs, to encode each
component of the complex, can be delivered simultaneously. Alternatively, mRNA
vaccines encoding proteins from different
pathogens can be combined into a single shot
so that you can be vaccinated against several
different infectious agents at the same time. Now that we've learned about
the potential advantages of mRNA medicines, in the next lesson,
we'll learn about the many challenges
that had to be overcome to fulfill
this promise.
