Welcome to medicines, small
molecules and proteins. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. Let's start with defining
the term medicine. The legal definition
of a medicine, medication or simply drug is a substance intended for
use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment
or prevention of disease. Many of us take medicines every
day in the form of pills. The active ingredients
of pills are generally known as
small molecules. Let's take a closer look at
small molecule medicines. As their name implies, small molecules are much
smaller than a protein or mRNA, more on the scale of a single amino acid or nucleotide
building block. Therefore, many can easily
cross cell membranes to work inside our cells without need of a special
delivery system. Small molecule medicines
have multiple advantages. First, most are able
to be formulated into solid forms that are stable for long times at
room temperature. Secondly, most can be
taken by mouth and once dissolved by the
digestive system can go everywhere in the body, including sometimes the brain. These small molecule medicines include antibiotics
such as penicillin, and painkillers,
such as ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic
acid or aspirin. The list goes on and on from medicines that treat
hay fever, nausea, high blood pressure, and high
cholesterol to those that treat psychiatric disorders like depression
and schizophrenia. Nonetheless, there are some
noteworthy limitations. In particular, current
day development of each new small molecule
medicine generally involves an initial screen through tens of
thousands of compounds, followed by years of
medicinal chemistry to mold an initial hit into
a potential medicine. Following that,
there are years of preclinical and clinical studies to prove that it is both
safe and effective. Unfortunately, most
small molecules drop out somewhere along the development journey due to either unanticipated toxicities
or lack of efficacy. Because of the need to screen so many compounds and
the high failure rate, small molecule drug
development is both very time consuming
and very expensive. The way almost all small molecule medicines
work is that they bind to a particular protein and change how that
protein functions. Some small molecule
medicines slow down or completely inhibit the
target protein's function. Others do the opposite and increase the target protein's
ability to function. Therefore, modulating the
activity of proteins is a general mechanism by which we can treat ailments
and disease. But proteins themselves
can also be medicines. They now make up a key
class of medicines known as therapeutic proteins
or protein biologics. Almost all proteins
currently in use as medicines do their
work in the bloodstream. Notable examples include
insulin used to treat diabetes, blood clotting factors
used to treat hemophilia, erythropoietin used to treat anemia, and monoclonal
antibodies, which have many different
uses ranging from warding off viral infections to treating
cancer and arthritis. As a class, monoclonal
antibodies have proven so efficacious that
between 2015 and 2020, the US Food and Drug
Administration, the FDA, approved about ten new monoclonal antibody
medicines per year. Individual proteins
from viruses and bacteria can also be
used as medicines, in this case, to prevent
future infection. These are called protein
subunit vaccines. Since they only constitute one small piece of
the infectious agent, protein subunit vaccines are generally safe and
cannot cause disease. Instead, they prime our immune
systems to recognize and respond to that specific virus
or bacteria in the future. Now, let's discuss some of the disadvantages of
protein medicines. Despite their advantages, protein medicines also
have notable limitations. For example, for the
first several decades of its use as a medicine, insulin was purified
from animals. However, animal insulin has a slightly different amino
acid sequence compared to human insulin and
was therefore prone to causing allergic
reactions in patients. Even more dire consequences were suffered by hemophiliacs. Prior to the development of
recombinant clotting factors, hemophiliacs we treated with clotting factors purified
from donated human blood. Contaminated blood products led to thousands of
patients contracting hepatitis in the 1960s
or aids in the 1980s. This was only corrected when appropriate screening
procedures were implemented in 1969 for hepatitis
and in 1985 for HIV. While some therapeutic
proteins are still purified from natural
sources, these days, most are made using mammalian
cell lines that have been genetically engineered to manufacture the
protein of interest. A word commonly used to
describe these cells, as well as the
therapeutic proteins they produce is recombinant, which loosely means
a new combination. Recombinant cells are grown in huge stainless steel
vats called bioreactors. Each bioreactor requires significant industrial
infrastructure to keep the cells alive and
free from contamination, so making therapeutic proteins is a very expensive endeavor. Further, because each
therapeutic protein is unique, each one separately requires significant work to
figure out how best to stabilize and formulate it so that it doesn't
degrade during storage, and ultimately functions as intended once injected
into the body. Finally, most proteins
can't easily enter cells, meaning that almost all
therapeutic proteins are limited to jobs either outside
of cells, for example, in the bloodstream, or in the special
compartments known as endosomes and lysosomes that cells use to take up nutrients
from their environment. But more than 90% of human
proteins reside either completely inside cells or are embedded within
cell membranes. If we tried to make and use these intracellular and
membrane proteins as medicines, they wouldn't be able to get to the proper location that
they need to function. This is where the idea of
mRNA medicines comes in. Instead of supplying
the human body with a pre-made protein, we could supply just
the instructions for making that protein, that is, the mRNA. This would enable our bodies to manufacture our own
therapeutic proteins, and because these
therapeutic proteins would be made inside
our own cells, any type of protein,
intracellular, membrane brand, or secreted
could become a medicine. Sounds so simple, but
of course, it's not. Our ability to use mRNA as a medicine has only
recently become possible due to decades of hard work by both academics and
industry researchers. In the later lessons
of this module, we'll learn about the many
barriers that had to be overcome to enable the
creation of mRNA medicines.
