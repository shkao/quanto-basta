Welcome back. Now let's learn about mRNA
delivery vehicles. Although many different types of mRNA delivery vehicles
are being tested, the most commonly
used to date are lipid nanoparticles or LNPs. Let's dig into the anatomy of an LNP and the function
of each component. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. Let's watch a video to learn more about lipid nanoparticles. Here is a lipid
nanoparticle or LNP. Inside, we have our
cargo, the mRNA. The rest of the LNP is made
of lipids, a form of fat. Lipids form the membranes surrounding all the
cells in your body. They are greasy or
hydrophobic molecules, meaning that they don't
mix well with water. Instead, they naturally form lipid bilayers like cell
membranes or spheres. LNPs are essentially just
really tiny fat balls. How do we make sure the mRNA
ends up inside the fat ball? In Module 1, we learned that mRNA
is highly negatively charged from the phosphates in its sugar phosphate backbone. Because opposite
charges attract, one way to get a
lipid to stick to mRNA is to make it always
positively charged. However, lipids that are always positively charged are not
well tolerated by the body. To overcome this challenge, researchers used a
clever engineering trick to develop ionizable lipids. These lipids are positively charged under some
conditions, but not others. These lipids will coat mRNA
under acidic conditions, but then switch back
to being uncharged under our physiological
conditions near neutral pH. Cool, huh? The
attraction between mRNA and the ionizable
lipids works to make sure they wrap
around their cargo, but it isn't strong
enough to be stable in a vial or to survive
long in the body. Another layer of packaging
is needed for strength. This is composed
of a double layer of a different type of lipid, a phospholipid, with
cholesterol interspersed. Both the phospholipid
bilayer and cholesterol are important components of
your own cell membranes. In this cryo-electron
microscope image of mRNA LNPs, you can clearly see
the dark interior containing the mRNA
and ionizable lipid, as well as the lipid bilayer membranes surrounding this core. Each LNP contains between
four and six mRNA molecules. For cells to efficiently
absorb them, LNPs need to be within
a certain size range. The typical diameter of an mRNA LNP is around
80-100 nanometers. That's 1/1,000th the
width of a human hair. They're so tiny
that each dose of an mRNA vaccine contains
trillions of individual LNPs. But LNPs are soft materials. If they were allowed to touch one another while in storage, they would fuse together, making bigger and bigger
fat balls as time goes by. So we have one final layer
of packaging to prevent the LNPs from fusing with one another while
they're in the vial. This layer is something
called surfactant. The most common surfactant
currently in use is polyethylene glycol
or PEG for short. PEG is found in many other
FDA approved medicines, as well as
over-the-counter products like cosmetics and toothpaste. When the PEG-coated LNPs
bump into one another, the PEG keeps the lipid bilayers from touching, thereby
preventing fusion. Once the mRNAs have
been appropriately packaged to keep them
stable during storage, they need to get
to the right place in the body upon injection. You've probably heard
of HDL and LDL. These are both examples of
lipid transport complexes. They ferry fats from one place to another
in our bloodstream. To the human body, LNPs look very much like
lipid transport complexes. Different lipid
transport complexes have affinity for specific
tissues and cell types. Similarly, LNPs
can be engineered to have affinity for particular
tissues and cell types. Once the LNP has reached
the target cell, how does the mRNA get inside? Cells take up LNPs by a
process called endocytosis. This is how cells
ingest material such as lipid transport complexes from the environment around them. The cell membrane
engulfs the material, then buds inwardly to create a special membrane-bound
compartment called an endosome. The final step in mRNA delivery
is for the LNP to fuse with the endosomal membrane and release the mRNA
into the cytoplasm, where it can interact
with ribosomes and be translated into protein. Once the mRNA is released, what happens to the lipids? The phospholipid
and cholesterol are normal parts of your
own cell membranes, so are metabolized like any
other lipids in your body. But don't worry, the amount of cholesterol administered in an mRNA medicine is minuscule compared to what's already
in the human body. Taking an mRNA vaccine
or a therapeutic has no effect on overall
cholesterol levels. Once in the body, the ionizable lipids and polyethylene glycol
have been engineered to break down into smaller
fragments that are rapidly eliminated by
normal metabolic processes. All of these fragments are
gone within a few days. Now that we have an
appreciation for how mRNA medicines overcome
barriers to delivery, we're next going to learn about another set of barriers
that had to be overcome: the innate
immune sentinels.
