Welcome back. In
the last lesson, we learned what messenger RNAs are and their general makeup. In this lesson, we'll learn how mRNAs function as the
blueprints for proteins. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. Hopefully, you'll remember that the m in mRNA stands
for messenger. These messages are
in the form of the genetic code.
What is a code? A code is a set of symbols
that can be variously arranged in a linear sequence
to convey information. One example is the binary
code used by computers, which consists of only two
symbols, one and zero. Other examples are
written human languages like Greek and English. Whereas written Greek uses 24 different symbols or
letters, English has 26. In both languages,
these letters can be variously arranged to
form words and sentences. We've already learned
that messenger RNAs are long chains of four
building blocks: A, C, G, and U, which of these building blocks or nucleotides are present, and the order in which
they are arranged along the chain forms a
four letter language, the genetic code, or
the language of life. Just like something written in binary computer code
or Greek needs to be translated to be understood by someone who can
only read English, the four-part genetic
code of mRNAs needs to be translated into the 20-part
amino acid code of proteins. Thus, the biological process
of making proteins using instructions encoded in
mRNA is called translation. Now, let's learn about the
cellular machinery that performs this translation
process. The ribosome. The tiny molecular machine that reads the
information stored in mRNA and translates it into a protein is called a ribosome. A ribosome moves along the mRNA and spits out the new
or nascent protein. Thus, ribosomes are your
internal protein factories. Here, we're watching one
ribosome manufacturing one protein on one mRNA
molecule, but really, this scene is more realistic
of what is actually going on inside your
cells with many, many ribosomes working on
lots of mRNAs simultaneously. Let's pause here and
watch for a while. Remarkably, in order to make all the proteins
your body requires, each one of your cells contains millions of
ribosomes, hard at work, manufacturing billions
of protein molecules from hundreds of thousands
of mRNA molecules. Remember that your
body is composed of over 30 trillion cells, so let's do some math. Thirty trillion cells times
a million ribosomes per cell comes to 30
quintillion ribosomes. That's 30 followed by 18 zeros. Altogether, these 30
quintillion ribosomes are working on over a
quintillion mRNA molecules. Wow, that is a lot going on. But how do ribosomes
actually use the information in mRNA
to create proteins? How do they know where to start, what amino acids to
string together, and then when to stop? To understand this, let's
go back and think about how information is encoded in
written human languages. In English, the signal
for the start of a sentence is a word starting
with a capital letter. Individual words consist of varying groups of letters
separated by spaces, and the end of a sentence
is denoted by a period. However, in the language
of mRNA, the genetic code, there are no capital
and lowercase letters, there are no spaces, and there are no
punctuation marks. Instead, the genetic
code consists of the 64 three-letter
words that can be made from all possible
combinations of A, C, G, and U. These three-letter words
are called codons, and 61 of them are used to code for different
amino acids. Looking at this table, let's see how this works, Let's suppose that a
particular protein requires the amino acid tryptophan
or tryp for short. The sole mRNA codon
for tryptophan is UGG, but if a valine or val
for short is required, there are four
different codons that all encode valine: GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG. Just like synonyms in English, some mRNA codons are
synonymous and have the same meaning when translated into the
language of amino acids. The existence of these
synonymous codons enables multiple different
mRNA sequences to encode the same protein. The codon AUG specifies
the amino acid methionine, abbreviated as met, and
also serves as a signal for where along the mRNA chain to
initiate protein synthesis. Three other codons: UAA, UGA, and UAG signify where
the ribosomes should stop. That is, they act like a
period punctuation mark, indicating where the
protein should end. Thus, AUG serves as
an initiation codon, and UAA, UGA, and UAG serve
as termination codons. Now that we understand the
structure of the genetic code, we can learn how the
translation process works. First, with the help of some accessory machinery
not shown here, half of the ribosome called the small subunit binds to
the beginning of the mRNA and scans along the strand until it encounters
the first instance of the initiation codon AUG. Once it's found in
initiation codon, the small subunit pauses and recruits the other half of the ribosome, the large subunit. Once the large subunit is in place, protein
synthesis commences. The ribosome ratchets
along the mRNA, one codon at a time, snapping the correct
amino acids in place to manufacture
the encoded protein. In human cells, a ribosome can string together about 60
amino acids per minute. This means that the
average human protein takes just a few
minutes to manufacture. When it reaches a
termination codon, the ribosome releases the
full length polypeptide, which completes its folding to become a functional protein. After its work is done, the two ribosomal
subunits dissociate and are ready to start the
process all over again. Finally, if you remember, I told you before that each cell in the human
body contains millions of ribosomes manufacturing
proteins from hundreds of thousands
of mRNA molecules. That means that
there are about 10 times as many ribosomes per cell as there
are mRNA molecules. Even though the movie
we just watched showed only one ribosome
translating an mRNA, in actuality, there
are usually multiple ribosomes moving along
each mRNA at any one time. This famous electron
micrograph captured an mRNA with over 30
ribosomes in transit. If you look closely at this
amazingly detailed image, you can see the mRNA as the thread that connects
all the ribosomes. The ribosomes
necessarily stretch out the mRNA as they move along. You can also distinguish the small and large subunits
of individual ribosomes. Further, you can tell that the ribosomes are
moving left to right, because the protein strands
emerging from the ribosomes on the right are longer than the protein
strands on the left. Finally, on the far right, you can even see the
proteins starting to fold into their final 3D shapes. It is estimated that
each mRNA molecule is translated hundreds
to thousands of times, meaning that each individual
mRNA molecule is used as the template for
hundreds to thousands of protein molecules. Exactly how many protein
molecules are made per mRNA depends on how rapidly
the ribosomes are loaded, how fast they move
along the mRNA, and how long the mRNA sticks around before it gets degraded. In the next lesson, we'll
learn where mRNAs come from.
