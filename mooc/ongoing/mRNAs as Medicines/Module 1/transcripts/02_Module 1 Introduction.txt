Welcome to Module 1 of our course,
mRNAs as Medicines. In this module, we'll lay the foundation
for understanding mRNA medicines by discussing proteins and
their roles in the human body. We will delve into the molecular
makeup of the human body, explore the concept of proteins
from a biological perspective, and understand the process
of protein synthesis. We will also discuss how
proteins are essential for all biological entities,
including viruses. This module will provide you with
a solid understanding of proteins and their significance in
the world of mRNA medicines.
