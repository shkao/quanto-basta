>> Welcome to Proteins and
their roles in human health. This course is about mRNA medicines, how
they work, and what they can be used for. But before we get there,
we need to talk about proteins. This is because the way mRNA medicines
actually function is by enabling the human body to make its own
medicines in the form of proteins. Please take a moment to review
the learning objectives for this lesson. Now, you may think of protein as
simply an important part of your diet, something you need to eat to build muscle. But it's not just muscle
that contains protein. Protein makes up about one-sixth of your
entire body weight, and it's not just you. Protein is an essential component
of every life form on earth. From the smallest viruses, to simple
single-celled organisms like bacteria and yeast, all the way up to the most
complex organisms like plants, animals, and ultimately us. Now let's think about proteins from
the point of view of the human body. In many ways,
your body functions like a large city. From this zoomed out view,
a city looks very uniform. But if we zoom in, we can see that it's really a complex
array of myriad interconnected buildings. These buildings come in all shapes and
sizes. What would we see if we were
to zoom in on ourselves? To see the molecular makeup of the human
body, we also need to zoom in. As we start to zoom, we can see that our
bodies are composed of multiple individual organs or tissues,
like the liver and the brain. As we zoom in some more,
we can see that these tissues, in turn, are each composed of millions
to billions of individual cells. To give you a sense of scale, the average human cell is only one 10th
the width of a strand of human hair. If we zoom in further still, we start
to see organelles like the nucleus, which contains our chromosomes,
and mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses
from which we derive energy. But if we zoom even further,
we can see that these organelles are themselves composed of
individual protein molecules. A typical human protein is only
around ten nanometers wide. That's really tiny. They're so tiny that billions
of individual protein molecules can fit inside each human cell. Let's take a closer look at the abundance
and importance of proteins in our body. Now let's consider cities and
buildings again. Just as the word building fails to capture
the incredible variety of structures that make up any large city, the generic term
protein gives no clue as to the amazing variety of protein architectures
that exist at the molecular level. Like buildings,
proteins are far from monolithic. Rather, proteins come in all shapes and
sizes. Some serve structural roles, like the
collagen that makes your skin tough but pliable, or the actin and myosin in
our muscles that enables us to move. Our blood contains lots of hemoglobin
that ferries oxygen, antibodies to help us fight off disease, and
clotting factors to close up our wounds. At the molecular level,
the numbers are truly mind blowing. Each of the more than 30 trillion cells
in your body, that's 3 with 13 zeros, contains somewhere between 1 and
10 billion protein molecules. This means that there are as many
individual protein molecules in your body as there are stars
in the known universe. Collectively, this huge constellation
of proteins that make you you is called your proteome. Amazingly, creating and maintaining a
healthy human requires the combined action of over 100,000 different kinds of
proteins, and your body makes them all. Thus, our bodies are remarkable
protein factories. Each different cell type in your body
makes different sets of proteins. For example, the rods and cones in your
eyes make a family of proteins called rhodopsins that collect light and
turn it into electrical impulses. While the neurons in your brain
make a different set of proteins to rapidly interpret those impulses and
enable you to see. But those proteins are just
the tip of the iceberg. Here's the metabolic
chart of the human body. It shows the hundreds of different
chemical reactions happening inside of you right now that are keeping you alive and
well. And each of these chemical
reactions is mediated or catalyzed by a different protein,
whose names are indicated here in blue. So proteins not only play important
structural roles in your body, they're also the machinery that makes
your body tick and keeps you healthy. Because building and
maintaining a human body involves so many different molecular parts. Like any complex building project, the process of protein synthesis
needs to be highly coordinated so that the right protein is made in
the right place and at the right time. With such a complicated system, however,
it shouldn't be surprising that there's an occasional mistake,
a miscalculation in the algorithm. Remember that metabolic chart? It's estimated that up to 1 in 1000
newborns is born without the ability to make a functional version
of one of these proteins, leading to lifelong complications due to
a permanent fault in their algorithm. Lets consider just one such inborn
metabolic disease, von Gierke disease. Babies born with von Gierke disease
don't make a functional version of a protein called glucose 6 phosphatase. This protein's job is to help release
sugars stored in the liver so that you can maintain appropriate blood
sugar levels when you're fasting. So children and adults who lack
this protein function can't fast. They must constantly consume
small amounts of carbohydrates, including getting up every few hours
during the night to eat raw cornstarch. You can imagine the toll
this takes on parents. If they ever miss a feeding, their child
can suddenly lapse into hypoglycemia, leading to seizures and potentially death. But even if they're able to keep
up this endless feeding schedule, these patients are plagued with many other
complications, including delayed puberty, frequent infections,
kidney disease, and liver cancer. And von Gierke disease is just one of a
myriad of such inborn metabolic disorders. For many, we now know exactly
what protein function is missing. What if we could give these patients
back the ability to make that one single protein? Then we could treat their disease
instead of just managing their symptoms. And that's where mRNA comes in, but
we'll talk more about that later. As we discussed before,
proteins are essential for all biological entities,
including viruses. Now, let's take a moment to learn
a little more about viral proteins. SARS-CoV-2, the virus
that causes COVID-19, has multiple different
proteins on its surface. The most talked about is the spike
protein, which sticks out and forms the crown, or corona,
that gives this viral family its name. The rest of the viral surface is made up
of additional viral proteins embedded in a sea of lipids. Lipids are a type of fat that
form viral and cell membranes. Now, if we take a cross
section of the virus, we can see that inside this
shell is an inner core. This inner core contains
even more proteins and the instructions to make
new viral particles. Now, viruses are not technically alive. To be alive, an organism needs to be
able to reproduce or replicate itself. But this requires a tremendous amount
of molecular machinery that viruses don't have. Because viruses only contain
the instructions for how to make the proteins necessary
to create new viral particles, they need to gain access to protein
synthesis machinery in a host cell, let's say a cell lining a human's airways. The virus then injects its instruction
set into the host cell to trick the host's protein synthesis machinery
into making the viral proteins. So when you're infected by
a virus like flu or SARS-CoV-2, the virus uses your cellular protein
factory to manufacture its own proteins. Thus, humans are the factories
that make new viral particles that go on to infect other humans. The good news is that your body has
the ability to tell the difference between human and viral proteins. It can differentiate self from non-self. This is the job of your immune system,
and we'll get back to this later. But first, we need to talk a little more
about what proteins actually look like and how your body actually manufactures them. This is the topic of the next lesson.
