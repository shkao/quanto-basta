Welcome to the course
MRNAs as Medicines, developed by Moderna, and offered globally
through Coursera. This comprehensive
course is for everyone, regardless of your current
scientific knowledge. It is designed to
provide you with a thorough understanding
of mRNA medicines, how they work, and their
potential applications. Whether you're a student, a health care professional, a prospective patient, or simply curious about this
groundbreaking technology. This course offers
valuable insights into the revolutionary field
of mRNA-based therapies. The course is divided
into three modules, each designed to build on the knowledge from
the previous one. One, introduction to
proteins and mRNAs. Two, learning about medicines, and three, applications
for mRNA medicines. In this course you will discover the incredible
diversity of roles played by proteins
in the human body, and appreciate their importance. You'll learn the basics of
mRNA and protein synthesis, and understand how mRNA instructs cells to
produce proteins. You'll learn about
different types of medicines, and from there, we'll delve into
how mRNA medicines work from concept to
practical applications. Then we'll delve into case studies of mRNA
medicines in vaccines, cancer treatment, and
genetic disorder therapies. Finally, we'll discuss
future developments and potential innovations
in mRNA technology. As you navigate the course, you will notice that a book icon pops up from time to time. This indicates the presence
of a glossary term. If the term appears
in on-screen text, it will be highlighted. If the term is spoken
during an animation, the icon and glossary term will briefly appear on the
bottom right of the screen. The definitions for these
words can be found in the mRNAs as medicines
glossary terms document, so be sure to have this file open as you proceed
through the modules. Now join us to explore the incredible potential
of mRNA as medicines, and discover how this technology is transforming healthcare. Let's embark on this
exciting journey together.
