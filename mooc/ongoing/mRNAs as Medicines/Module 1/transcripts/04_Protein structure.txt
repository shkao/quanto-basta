Welcome back. In
the last lesson, we learned that the
human body contains hundreds of thousands
of different proteins. Much like a large city contains thousands and thousands
of different buildings. In this lesson, we will
dive into how proteins are built and how their structures
determine their function. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. If we think about
buildings again, even though their final forms
can look quite different, what they all have in
common is that they're constructed from a limited
set of component parts, like wood, stone,
metal, and glass. How these parts are
arranged and attached to one another is what dictates
their final structure. The same is true of proteins. What those parts are and
how they drive formation of three dimensional structures is the subject of the next video. Starting with a fully
assembled protein, in this case, human insulin, the protein hormone that helps us regulate blood sugar levels, let's deconstruct it
and see how it's built. If we unravel insulin's three
dimensional architecture, we can see that it's
actually two long chains composed of tiny building
blocks called amino acids, 51 to be exact. All amino acids share a common chemical architecture
or underlying scaffold. Attached to this
common scaffold is a side chain that makes
each amino acid unique. In all, there are 20
different amino acids, each having a
different side chain. Their common architecture allows amino acids to connect to one another like pop beads and
form long chains or polymers. A polymer is simply
a long strand of repeating building
blocks called monomers. In a pop bead chain, each pop bead is a monomer. When amino acid
monomers pop together, they form strong peptide bonds. A string of amino acids is
often called a polypeptide. Which amino acids are present and the order
in which they're arranged dictates
how the chain will fold up into a three
dimensional shape. It's this unique three
dimensional architecture that gives each protein
its specific function. In humans, the median protein is a string of 375
amino acid monomers. At 51 amino acids, insulin is on the small side. The largest human
protein is titin, a key component of muscles. As its name implies,
titin is gargantuan, consisting of a string of up to 35,000 amino acid monomers. Once they assume
their 3D shapes, some proteins are ready to
function all on their own. One example is human
serum albumin, the most abundant protein
in human blood plasma, constituting almost half
of total serum protein. Made by the liver, serum
albumin is a chain of 585 amino acids that fold
up into a globular shape. Serum albumin performs
many functions, including maintenance
of osmotic pressure, acting to buffer serum pH, and transporting
hormones, fatty acids, and other biological
compounds around the body. Now, let's look inside one
of these red blood cells. Here, you can see
that the scaffold that gives the red blood cell its shape is made up of many different
proteins connected like lego building blocks. Each of these
proteins is one part of a multiprotein complex. Amazingly, most of these larger multiprotein
complexes are able to self-assemble once all of the individual protein
parts are available. Perhaps the best studied multiprotein complex
is hemoglobin, the highly abundant protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen and gives them
their red color. Hemoglobin contains four
separate polypeptide chains, two chains of Alpha globin, and two chains of Beta globin. When these four
chains come together, they form binding sites for another molecule called heme, which provides the site
for oxygen binding. Now that we understand
the fundamentals of protein structure
and function, we'll next learn about how each different cell type
knows which proteins to make. Where do the
instructions come from?
