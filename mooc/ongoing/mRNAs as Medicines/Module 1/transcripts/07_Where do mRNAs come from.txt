Welcome back. Now that we understand
how proteins are made by using the information
encoded in mRNA, the next question becomes, where do the mRNAs come from? Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. While translation is
the biological process of making proteins from mRNA, transcription is the process
of making RNA from DNA. In our cells, the
permanent repository of genetic information
is our genomic DNA. Like mRNA, DNA is made up of
long chains of nucleotides. In the case of genomic DNA, these chains can be hundreds of millions
of nucleotides long. Each chain is tightly packed into a structure we
call a chromosome. Chromosomes reside in the
cell nucleus and contain all the information needed to create and maintain
a functioning human. But each cell type only needs to access just a tiny fraction of that vast information library to make its specific
set of proteins. When a cell needs to make
a particular protein, it copies that bit
of genemic DNA into RNA via a process
called transcription. The protein that makes
these RNA copies or transcripts is called
RNA polymerase. The initial RNA transcript goes through a series
of maturation steps, which we won't discuss
here to generate an mRNA. This mature mRNA is then transported out
of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where the process of protein
translation occurs. This is a one way trip. Once the mRNA is
in the cytoplasm, it cannot go back
into the nucleus. This flow of information
from DNA to mRNA to protein is known as the
central dogma of biology. DNA, the permanent repository
of genetic information, is transcribed into mRNA, a transient copy of just the information needed to make a single specific protein, and the information
in the mRNA is translated by ribosomes
into proteins.
