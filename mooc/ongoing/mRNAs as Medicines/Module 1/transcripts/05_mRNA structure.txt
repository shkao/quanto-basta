Welcome back, in the previous two lessons,
we've learned that proteins are strings of amino acid building blocks that
self-assemble into complex 3D structures and that the human body makes hundreds
of thousands of different proteins. Further, different cell types make
different sets of proteins to enable each cell type to perform
its specific function. Thus, your liver cells contain a different
set of proteins than your muscle cells. But how does each cell type know
which proteins to make and how much? Where do the instructions come from? You will learn the answers
to these questions and more in this lesson on mRNA structure. Please take a moment to review
the learning objectives for this lesson. Going back to our building analogy,
the instructions for creating a building are in
the form of blueprints. The same is true for proteins. The blueprints for proteins are called
messenger RNAs or mRNAs for short. As their name implies,
messenger RNAs carry messages, messages for how to make proteins. Now, let's watch a short video to learn
more about mRNAs and their structure. Like proteins,
mRNAs can fold up into complex structures. This is because the nitrogenous bases
compare with one another to form a double strand. These double stranded regions intersperse
with single stranded regions to form complex, floppy structures. We can directly visualize mRNA
structures using a technique called atomic force microscopy, or AFM. The principle of AFM is
really quite simple. It involves dragging a very,
very fine needle across a surface on which is deposited the tiny
object one wants to image. As the needle is dragged
across the surface, it has to move first up and
then down to get past the object. The different heights are then
detected by a laser and recorded. With repeated passes,
a three-dimensional image develops. This image shows three identical
883 nucleotide mRNA molecules that contain the blueprints for
green fluorescent protein, or GFP, a protein that makes
jellyfish glow under UV light. What you can see is that even though
they have exactly the same pattern of A, C, G and U, that is,
they have the same nucleotide sequence, each individual molecule
folds in a different way. This next image shows many more molecules
of different mRNAs that contain the blueprints for GFP, for firefly
luciferase, which is the protein that enables fireflies to glow, or
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In fact, this last mRNA is exactly
the mRNA sequence that went into Moderna's original Covid-19 vaccine. So what you can see is
that mRNAs are floppy, string-like molecules that fold
up into a variety of structures. In many ways, these structures resemble those formed
by old fashioned telephone cords. So now, we understand what mRNAs are and
their basic structure. In the next lesson, we'll learn how the information stored
in mRNA is decoded to create proteins.
