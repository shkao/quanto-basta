Welcome back to the
final lesson of our course where we will learn
about a third category of mRNA medicines currently
in development : non-immunogenic
mRNA medicines. In contrast to
prophylactic vaccines and immunogenic mRNA therapies, where the goal is to elicit an adaptive immune
response to either protect against an infectious
agent or eliminate cancer, the goal of non-immunogenic mRNA therapeutics is to supply the instructions
for a protein that can produce a specific
therapeutic effect. Let's start this lesson
by talking about protein replacement
therapies for patients with inborn
genetic errors. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. In the very first module, I showed you this metabolic
chart which details all of the biochemical reactions
happening inside of you right now to keep
you alive and well. Many of these reactions
are required for you to extract energy from food, while others enable
your cells to create new building materials
like fats and proteins. If you remember, each one of these reactions is
mediated or catalyzed by a different protein
whose names appear here in blue beside
each chemical reaction. These proteins that catalyze chemical reactions
are called enzymes. It is estimated that around
1 in 1,000 newborns are born without the ability
to make one of the metabolic enzymes
shown on this chart. Such individuals suffer
lifelong complications due to a small fault in
their genetic algorithm. There are hundreds of
different kinds of these so-called inborn
metabolic diseases, dependent on which enzyme or biochemical pathway is affected. Because the vast majority of metabolic enzymes are
intracellular, that is, they function inside cells, these disorders cannot
be treated by supplying a protein therapeutic
made outside the body. For most of these disorders, no therapy other than simple symptom management has
previously been possible. But because mRNAs can supply a patient with
the instructions to make inside their own cells the exact enzyme
they're missing, mRNA medicines known as
protein replacement therapies are a promising new approach for the treatment of many
of these conditions. Let's recall the inborn
metabolic disease, glycogen storage disease type
I or Von Gierke disease, that we introduced in Module 1. Von Gierke disease is
due to deficiency of a protein called
glucose 6-phosphatase. This protein's job is to
help release stored sugars so that you can maintain appropriate blood sugar
levels when you're fasting. If you remember, children and adults who lack this
protein can't fast. They must constantly consume small amounts of carbohydrates, including getting
up every few hours during the night to
eat raw cornstarch. Even if they're able to keep up this endless
feeding schedule, these patients are plagued with many other lifelong
medical complications. The organ that makes the most glucose 6-phosphatase
is the liver. This is true for many
metabolic enzymes. The liver is the largest internal organ in
the human body. Because the liver is so large, large doses of therapeutic mRNAs are required to generate
a therapeutic effect. Unlike vaccines where a
very small amount of mRNA, often as little as
tens of micrograms, can elicit the desired response, enzyme replacement requires many milligrams of
therapeutic mRNA. That is over 1,000 times more, but this is still
tiny compared to the grams of mRNA already
present in the body. Further, whereas mRNA
vaccines can be delivered intramuscularly or
intradermally to stimulate an adaptive
immune response, mRNA therapeutics for
enzyme replacement must be delivered systemically, that is, intravenously to ensure that it will
reach the liver. Also, because mRNA
is impermanent, lasting several days
to a week at best, enzyme replacement using
an mRNA therapeutic requires chronic repeat dosing. So creating mRNA therapies for chronic conditions such as
Von Gierke disease require development of LNPs that are
both efficiently taken up by the appropriate cell type in the liver and are suitable
for chronic dosing. In 2018, Moderna scientists published a research
article showing how lipid nanoparticles could
be engineered to allow for repeat dosing via
IV administration. This and other innovations enabled Moderna to take
the lead in testing mRNA medicines for
long-term treatment of genetic disorders caused by a lack of a specific
metabolic enzyme. As of the recording of
this course, mid 2024, the first enzyme
replacement therapies using mRNA are showing promise in
early stage clinical trials. While not providing a cure, which is the realm
of gene therapy and permanent genome editing, a major advantage of an
mRNA medicine is that its dose can be adjusted according to each
patient's needs. Also, if there are any
undesirable side effects, the patient can either decrease their dose or simply stop
taking the medicine. In addition to
intracellular enzymes, another type of
protein missing in some genetic disorders are proteins embedded
in cell membranes. An example here is
cystic fibrosis or CF, the most common fatal
genetic condition affecting people of
European descent. Patients with CF produce thick sticky mucus that can affect multiple organ systems, with the most problematic
being the lungs. The problem in CF is an inability to maintain an appropriate
balance of salt and water across cell
membranes due to a fault in a protein
called CFTR. Fortunately, many CF
patients make a form of this protein whose
function can be restored with a small
molecule medicine. But about 10% of affected individuals make
no CFTR protein at all. For this patient subgroup, a potential treatment is CFTR protein replacement via an inhalable mRNA therapeutic. Clinical trials are
currently underway for these patients with
an mRNA medicine being delivered
through an inhaler. LNP delivery vehicles
for this medicine were specifically developed to remain intact during aerosolization, that is the conversion of a
liquid into a fine spray, and to be
preferentially taken up by the cells lining the
airways in the lung, whose job it is to make
mucus more watery. Another potential use for mRNA therapeutics is in
regenerative medicine, such as stimulation of
new blood vessel growth, repair of damaged muscles, or scarless wound healing. Most regenerative
pathways are initiated by one or more early signaling
events mediated by proteins. These events kick off a cascade
of subsequent events that eventually direct
resident stem cells to divide and to differentiate
into the desired tissue type. These so-called immediate
early signaling events need to be highly
localized and short-lived, characteristics that make it a perfect use case for local, single-dose delivery of mRNA encoding the relevant
signaling protein. Repeated dosing should not be required for these
applications because the signaling protein is needed only to initiate the cascade. Examples currently
being explored, either pre-clinically
or clinically, include injection
of an mRNA encoding VEGF into the heart muscle during open heart
surgery to stimulate the growth of new
cardiac blood vessels or treatment of stress
urinary incontinence by injection of an mRNA encoding a specific growth
factor protein into damaged muscles around
the urinary sphincter. While all regenerative
mRNA medicines are still in early
stage development, the pre-clinical
and clinical data presented so far seem
quite promising. Finally, another promising
potential application for mRNA medicines is to stimulate the body to produce a
specific secreted protein. In Module 2, we learned that proteins that
work in the bloodstream can be used as medicines by
injecting a pre-made protein. The examples we mentioned
included insulin, clotting factors, and
monoclonal antibodies. But mRNA medicines can
enable the human body to be its own factory for
making such proteins. In 2021, Moderna published
a study showing that mRNA LNPs can be used to direct the human body to make functional
monoclonal antibodies. In that case, it was antibodies capable of neutralizing
chikungunya virus. Because the monoclonal
antibody is made within hours of
delivering the mRNA, this type of mRNA medicine
can potentially be used to treat an already
established viral infection. However, because antibodies have half-lives of only 10-21 days, the protection would be
relatively short-lived. Thus, monoclonal antibodies cannot substitute for vaccines, which provide
long-lived protection against future exposure
to the relevant pathogen. Also in development are
mRNA medicines encoding other secreted proteins such
as cytokines, hormones, and immune modulatory proteins
to treat disorders ranging from cancer to
cardiovascular disease to autoimmune conditions. As of the recording
of this course, no mRNA therapeutics
have yet to complete the full clinical trial process necessary for
regulatory approval. However, given their tremendous
potential to address medical conditions where no good treatment currently exists, many companies and academic
medical centers are now investing heavily in their
research and development.
