Welcome back, in the previous two lessons, we focused on using mRNA medicines
as vaccines to prevent disease. We'll now turn our attention to
other types of mRNA medicines, medicines with the potential
to treat existing disease. These medicines are known
as mRNA therapeutics, please take a moment to review
the learning objectives for this lesson. Because mRNA therapeutics are so new,
as of the creation of this course in mid 2024, no mRNA therapeutics have
completed all of the clinical trial phases required for final approval
by government regulatory agencies. Nonetheless, because of their
potential to fulfill so many critical unmet medical needs,
there are a multitude of mRNA therapeutics at various stages of development, with
many already undergoing clinical testing. Let's first learn about how mRNA
medicines might be used to treat cancer. Cancer happens when a particular
cell in the body acquires enough mutations in its genomic DNA
that it no longer responds to the normal signals that
keep its growth in check. The cell begins to divide and
multiply inappropriately, and a tumor starts to grow. Additional mutations are acquired
as the tumor cells divide, enabling some of them to
invade nearby tissues. Eventually, if left untreated,
parts of the original tumor may start to migrate to more distant sites in the body,
resulting in metastatic cancer. One of the most significant advances
leading to new treatments in cancer in recent years was
the realization that cytotoxic t cells, the same white blood
cells that recognize and eliminate viral infected cells,
also worked to protect us from cancer. That is, in addition to protecting
us from infectious disease, cytotoxic t cells are constantly
patrolling our bodies to find and eliminate our own cells that may
become cancerous, how do they do this? With the exception of red blood cells,
every cell in your body displays on its outer surface around
100,000 copies of a protein called Major Histocompatibility Complex Class 1,
also known as MHC-1. The job of these membrane bound
MHC-1 proteins is to showcase fragments of all the different proteins
that are made inside that cell. In a way, MHC-1 acts like a badge, and the protein fragments it
displays are the ID cards, proving that they belong in the body and
that they have a legitimate job to do. Cytotoxic t cells constantly monitor
these protein fragment ID cards, looking for
fragments from non self proteins. A non self protein could be
a protein from an invading pathogen, a self protein that has become mutated and
is on its way toward cancer, or any protein not normally
present in the body. If a cytotoxic t cell finds
evidence of non self proteins, the cell presenting that information
is targeted for elimination. That's why they're called cytotoxic
t cells, cyto means cell and toxic means poisonous. Cytotoxic t cells eliminate our own cells
when they're producing something unusual. Although the number of specific or consequential mutations required to
develop cancer is between 1 and 10, most cancers contain more than 10,000 so
called non germline mutations. These mutations arise due to errors
during DNA replication and cell division. The vast majority of these non germline
mutations aren't actually involved in cancer development and progression. But some of these inconsequential
mutations can be used by the immune system to recognize and eliminate the cancer
cells if they cause an entirely new protein to be made or change the amino
acid sequence of a normal protein. These mutant proteins are unique
to that cancer, they are called neoantigens because they are both new and
now recognized as non self. When fragments of a neoantigen
are displayed by MHC-1, their ID card says I don't belong. Researchers are now developing and testing
individualized neoantigen therapies, or INTs, also known as
personalized cancer vaccines. To take advantage of non
germline mutations and train the immune system to recognize
an individual's unique cancer. An individualized neoantigen therapy is
similar to a prophylactic vaccine in that it activates the body's adaptive immune
system to respond to a specific threat. But in this case,
instead of a foreign pathogen, the threat comes from cancer
cells already in the body. The first step in creating
an individualized neoantigen therapy is to map all the mutations present in that
individual individual specific cancer and not in their normal tissues, that is, identify all potential neoantigens
present in the cancer. This is done by performing deep genome
sequencing on both a tumor biopsy and a blood sample. Advanced bioinformatic analysis
are then able to identify which cancer cell mutations will
produce a neoantigen and predict which ones are most likely to
show up as an ID card on the MHC-1 badge. With those peptides identified,
it's possible to design one or more mRNA's encoding them. Often, the mRNA provides the instructions
for a single long polypeptide that will be chopped up into smaller pieces for
display by antigen presenting cells. After manufacturing the mRNA, formulating
it into an appropriate lipid nanoparticle, and performing all of
the necessary safety and quality control testing,
the therapy is ready for use. Remarkably, the entire process,
from obtaining the tumor and blood samples to delivering the finished
medicine back to the clinical team, can be done in under a month and a half. To generate a cytotoxic t cell response
in the patient, the therapy must then be administered by multiple intramuscular
injections days to weeks apart. So, similar to the way prophylactic
vaccines are designed to activate our adaptive immune system to recognize
a patient potential pathogen, individualized neoantigen therapies
are designed to stimulate a cytotoxic t cell response against cancer
cells already in our body. Thus, the goal of both
prophylactic vaccines and individualized neoantigen therapies is
to generate an adaptive immune response. Together, they form a class called
immunogenic mRNA medicines. In the next lesson, we'll learn about mRNA
medicines, where the goal is to treat an existing disorder without
generating an adaptive immune response. These therapeutics can be thought of
as non immunogenic mRNA medicines.
