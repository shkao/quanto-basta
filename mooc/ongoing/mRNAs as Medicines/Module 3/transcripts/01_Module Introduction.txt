Welcome back. In this module, we will explore the different
types of mRNA medicines and their potential applications for preventing and
treating disease. We will discuss
how mRNA medicines can be used as vaccines to prevent disease or as therapies to treat
existing disease. We will also delve
into the potential of mRNA medicines to treat
genetic disorders, as well as create an
entirely new class of regenerative medicines. This module will
provide you with an overview of the
exciting potential of mRNA medicines to address a broad spectrum of
human disorders.
