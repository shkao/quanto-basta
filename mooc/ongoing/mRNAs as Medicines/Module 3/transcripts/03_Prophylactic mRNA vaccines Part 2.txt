Welcome back. In the previous lesson, we learned how vaccines
work in general and specifically how
mRNA vaccines work. In this lesson, we'll learn about some
other attributes of mRNA vaccines that make them so promising for future
vaccine development. We'll also learn about
some current limitations requiring additional research. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. One beneficial feature of mRNA vaccines is that they
can be readily multiplexed. This means that instead
of just delivering a single mRNA sequence supplying the instructions to
make only one protein, several different mRNAs can be combined and delivered
in a single vaccine. Multiplexing is
especially useful when the antigen is a
multi-protein complex. In the case of
cytomegalovirus, CMV, one key antigen is a complex of five different
protein subunits. Combining all five mRNAs, each encoding the
instructions to make one of the
individual subunits, into a single vaccine enables antigen-presenting
cells to produce all five proteins
simultaneously, assemble them properly,
and efficiently display the complete complex
on their outer surface. This multi-protein
complex generates a much more robust
immune response than if only one
subunit were displayed. In addition to the five mRNAs encoding the
multi-protein complex, Moderna's CMV vaccine contains a sixth mRNA encoding
the CMV gB protein. This protein serves as
an additional antigen, enabling an even more
robust immune response against cytomegalovirus. Similarly, multiplexing
mRNAs into a single vaccine also makes it possible to create combination vaccines against
multiple infectious agents. You're likely to remember that the SARS-CoV-2
virus evolved over time to produce
different variants that also spread globally. In response, new
bivalent mRNA vaccines containing two different
mRNA sequences were developed to protect against both the original
Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and a later
emerging variant. The future, mRNA
vaccine makers envision developing combination
vaccines against multiple different
viruses at once, such as a combination
respiratory vaccine against respiratory
syncytial virus, also known as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and seasonal flu. With combination or
multiplexed vaccines, you might be wondering how
drug makers manage to ensure that each LNP contains
all the different mRNAs. Actually, this isn't necessary. Each mRNA sequence
has its own potency, which is a measure of
strength or power. In other words, how many
mRNA molecules are needed to create enough protein to elicit an appropriate
immune response? Because some antigens are
more immunogenic than others, different antigens require
different amounts of mRNA to elicit the
desired immune response. For most multiplexed vaccines, the different mRNAs
are mixed together at a predetermined ratio based on their individual potencies, and then loaded randomly
into lipid nanoparticles. Because the LNPs are so small, each one can only hold
a few mRNA molecules, but a single vaccine injection contains trillions
of individual LNPs, and each antigen-presenting
cell likely takes up tens to hundreds of these
individual lipid nanoparticles. As a result, all of the
different mRNA molecules are efficiently delivered
regardless of which LNP brought them there. In theory, there's no limit to the number of different mRNAs
that can be multiplexed. mRNA vaccines are
limited, however, by the maximum tolerated
dose or MTD of the LNP. That is the largest
amount of LNP that can be dosed without causing severe
side effects or reactions. As the number of different
mRNA sequences increases, the amount of each
individual mRNA must decrease to stay under the
maximum tolerated LNP dose. The limitation to
the number of mRNAs that can be included in a
single vaccine, therefore, is not how many
different mRNAs can be packaged into a
single LNP particle, but how much of each individual mRNA is needed to elicit the
appropriate immune response. For this reason, creating multiplexed or
combination vaccines requires significant
research and optimization to determine
the right proportion of mRNA sequences to get an appropriate immune
response to every antigen. Now, let's talk
about the resources and time required to
develop vaccines. In this section, we'll compare the traditional
process for making annual flu vaccines to the process for
making mRNA vaccines. Most current-day flu
vaccines, for example, are made from flu virus grown in fertilized chicken eggs with each egg providing only
a single vaccine dose. That means more than 100
million eggs are required every year just to make enough
vaccine for the US alone. Imagine how many chickens are required to lay
100 million eggs, and then how much
space is needed to raise the chickens
and store the eggs. The space where the eggs are kept also has to be carefully, environmentally controlled
for temperature and humidity to keep
the eggs alive. That's a lot of animals, space, and energy annually. Other traditional vaccines are created from pathogens grown in large bioreactors
using various types of tissue culture cells. These might be mammalian
or insect cells. In contrast to
current flu vaccines, 100 million doses of an mRNA vaccine require
no chickens or eggs. A hundred million doses of an
mRNA vaccine can be made in 10-20 large scale
biochemical reactions using equipment no bigger
than a large refrigerator. So mRNA vaccines have much lower resource
requirements and, importantly, no animals or animal products are needed
to make mRNA vaccines. Another advantage
of mRNA vaccines compared to flu
vaccines grown in chicken eggs is that mRNA vaccines can be
produced very quickly. Moderna's original
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was manufactured and quality
controlled in just 42 days, whereas producing a
new flu vaccine from chicken eggs takes 5-7 months. Unfortunately, because
flu mutates so rapidly, it's possible for the
genetic makeup of circulating virus variants
to drift substantially between the time
vaccine manufacturing begins and when the vaccine is ready to go into
people's arms. Further, because
the flu vaccine is made from live viruses
grown in eggs, there can also be genetic drift happening in the
eggs themselves. These twin drifts contribute
to lower vaccine efficacy. Dependent on the year, current flu vaccines vary
from 60% to just under 40%. In comparison, there's
no possibility of genetic drift in the mRNA
vaccine manufacturing process. Combined with their much
shorter manufacturing times, mRNA vaccines are
likely to better match circulating viral variance at
the time of administration. Therefore, mRNA vaccines
against annual flu and other fast-mutating seasonal
viruses could ultimately result in increased
effectiveness compared to the
current standard. Finally, the relatively small infrastructure
requirements for making mRNA vaccines means that manufacturing sites can be distributed
throughout the world. For most medicines, the
production process and infrastructure
requirements are highly specific to that
individual medicine. Therefore, they tend
to be produced in just a few centralized
facilities and then distributed from there. In contrast, an mRNA sequence is simply
a string of letters that can be stored digitally and sent anywhere in the
world instantaneously. Thus, once researchers
have determined an optimal mRNA sequence
for a particular purpose, it can be sent out
to a network of small manufacturing
facilities for local manufacturing
and distribution. Because all mRNA molecules are made of just four
building blocks, the materials
required to produce different mRNAs are the same regardless of
their final sequence. Similarly, the ingredients and processes for making lipid
nanoparticles is the same, regardless of the mRNA sequence or sequences being encapsulated. This makes it very
simple to replicate the entire process for local
production and distribution. In the future, by enabling local public health
authorities to quickly respond
to new outbreaks, this could help
decrease the spread of novel infectious
agents locally, and therefore the threat of
another worldwide pandemic. Manufacturing facilities
for mRNA vaccines now exist on every continent
except Antarctica. There are also
efforts underway to miniaturize the entire
manufacturing process so that it can fit into a
single cargo container ready to be shipped anywhere in the world at a
moment's notice. Future innovations
might even enable mRNA vaccines to be
made on the bench top. In contrast to their
many advantages, mRNA vaccines do currently have some notable disadvantages. One is the relative
fragility of mRNA. You may remember that the original SARS-CoV-2
vaccines had to be shipped and stored at ultracold
temperatures and administered very soon after
being allowed to thaw. This fragility is partly due
to RNA's chemical structure. It has a tendency to
break into pieces. The rate at which this happens is highly temperature-dependent. So degradation of intact vaccine is significantly slower
when it's frozen. Given the severity of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic and the lack of other alternatives, these strict
temperature conditions were tolerated at that time. But maintaining a functional
cold chain is very expensive and generally limited to more affluent and
populated regions. Therefore, a strict
cold chain requirement is not desirable under
normal circumstances. The good news is that, in the time since the first SARS-CoV-2
vaccines were distributed, mRNA vaccine manufacturers have already made tremendous progress in slowing down the
chemical reactions that inactivate mRNA vaccines. For example, as of the recording of this
course, mid 2024, Moderna's updated versions of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be stored for up to a month
in the refrigerator, and there are other ways to preserve mRNA vaccine potency. For example, they
can be lyophilized, which means the vaccine is dehydrated and stored
as a dry powder. This powder can then
be reconstituted with liquid immediately
prior to administration. Alternatively, researchers are investigating
the possibility of incorporating mRNA vaccines into solid microneedle patches. Microneedle patches
could potentially be stored at ambient
temperature would be easy to transport anywhere in the world
and could be administered simply by applying the patch to the skin like an
adhesive bandage. An additional advantage
of microneedles is that they only penetrate into the
dermis layer of the skin, not the underlying muscle. Our skin is the primary barrier that prevents entry
of infectious agents. Accordingly, the dermis has even more
antigen-presenting cells called Langerhan cells
than do skeletal muscles. So although intramuscular
injection is a very common means for
vaccine administration, intradermal administration
can generate even stronger responses
with smaller doses. Similarly, the greatest
protection against pathogens that enter the body
through a mucosal pathway, such as the respiratory system, is achieved by delivering the vaccine to the
relevant mucosal lining. This stimulates a much
stronger mucosal immunity. In addition to microneedles, numerous efforts are now underway to develop
mRNA vaccines that can be delivered
to the respiratory or other mucosal systems. Undoubtedly, now that
the first mRNA vaccines have proven safe and effective, the next few years will see rapid advancement in mRNA
vaccine technologies, both to make them more
stable and to increase their effectiveness against a broad range of
infectious agents. With that thought,
our discussion of prophylactic mRNA vaccines
has come to an end. In the next lesson, we'll turn our attention
to mRNA medicines being developed to treat disease
instead of just prevent it.
