Welcome to prophylactic
mRNA vaccines. Now that we've learned
about the attributes of mRNAs that make them suitable as medicines and all
of the challenges that had to be overcome to
realize this potential, we're finally ready to
dig into the types of disorders that mRNA medicines can either prevent or treat. Please take a moment to review the learning objectives
for this lesson. First, let's talk
about vaccines. Specifically, vaccines
meant to prevent disease. This type of vaccine is known
as a prophylactic vaccine. We'll start here because the very first mRNA
medicines to be approved and widely administered were the mRNA vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2. Until very recently,
the traditional method of vaccination was to
expose the recipient to a small amount of a
pathogen that's been inactivated or an
active but weakened. That is attenuated pathogen. Pathogens may be
viruses or bacteria. The polio and
typhus vaccines are good examples of inactivated
pathogen vaccines. While the MMR vaccine,
measles, mumps, and Rubella is an example of an attenuated
pathogen vaccine. The safety of an inactivated
pathogen vaccine depends on the pathogen being thoroughly inactivated or killed
prior to administration. If the pathogen is not
completely killed, the vaccine can
actually cause disease. In an infamous case in 1955, known as the Cutter Incident, Cutter laboratories
released a batch of polio virus that they had failed to
completely inactivate. When it was used
for vaccination, it caused more than
40,000 cases of polio, lifelong paralysis for 200
people, and 10 deaths. Similarly, patients with
weakened immune systems or who take an
immunosuppressant because they've had an organ
transplant are often advised against taking
attenuated pathogen vaccines. This is because their weaker immune systems may not be able to control any type of infection even by a
weakened pathogen. The way all vaccines work is to expose our
immune systems to a new infectious agent in a relatively safe way so that we can develop an
adaptive immune response. The first step in building
an immune response involves specialized white
blood cells called antigen-presenting
cells or APCs. Their job is to constantly be on the lookout for
anything unusual, ingest potential pathogens, and display proteins
or fragments of proteins from it on
their own cell surface. The proteins or bits of protein they display
are called antigens. Gen for generate, and
anti for against. Therefore, an antigen
is something that generates an immune response
against a pathogen. Antigen-presenting cells
travel back and forth between the tissues they patrol and
nearby draining lymph nodes. When they arrive
in a lymph node, APCs present any
antigens they've picked up on patrol to
immature B and T cells. If one of these B or T cells is able to recognize a
presented antigen, it will develop into
a mature B or T cell. Mature B cells secrete
proteins called antibodies that can bind to
and neutralize the pathogen. Cytotoxic T cells,
on the other hand, seek out the source of the
infection and eliminate any infected cells
before they can be exploited to produce
more of the pathogen. mRNA vaccines work in a
similar but different way. With traditional vaccines, APCs ingest the entire pathogen. With mRNA vaccines, the
pathogen is replaced by LMPs. The APCs ingest
the LMPs carrying mRNA instructions for how to manufacture one or more
pathogen proteins. Then use their own ribosomes to make those proteins
for surface display. Previously, we learned that mRNA is inherently transient, so once it's inside the
antigen-presenting cells, it lasts just a short time. In animal studies, mRNAs formulated with the
same LMP used for Moderna's SARS-CoV-2
vaccine were undetectable after
just three days. Similarly, the
antigenic proteins are only present for a
limited time as well. Although a single exposure
to a strong antigen can be sufficient to generate an initial adaptive
immune response, a second and even
third exposure often results in stronger and
more durable responses. Like most traditional vaccines, optimal protection from
an mRNA vaccine requires both a first or prime dose and one or more subsequent
booster doses given weeks to months later. In the next lesson, we'll learn more about
some special features of mRNA vaccines.
