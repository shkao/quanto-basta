## A Target-Based Example - Complement Factor B Inhibitor

### Learning Objectives

- Contrast target-based drug discovery to a phenotypic drug discovery program
- Describe how structural biology tools can assist lead optimization

### Target-based & phenotypic discovery

- **Phenotypic discovery**:
  - Drug target unknown
  - Lead selection/optimization via activity in cells/tissues

- **Target-based discovery**:
  - Drug target known
  - Lead selection/optimization via target-based biochemical, biophysical, & structural biology assays

### Factor B & the complement system

- Factor B, a protein with serine protease activity, is part of the complement system.
- The complement system is a biological pathway associated with the destruction of pathogens, damaged cells, and inflammation.
- A factor B inhibitor may treat chronic inflammatory diseases.

## Biomarkers

### Learning Objectives

- Define the term biomarker
- List different types of biomarkers
- Outline how biomarkers support drug hunting

### Biomarker definitions & examples

- **Biomarker definition (U.S. FDA)**:
  - "A defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions."

- **Antimalarial program example**:
  - Reduction in parasitemia

- **Surrogate (validated surrogate endpoint)**:
  - A biomarker with a clear mechanistic rationale and clinical data providing strong evidence that an effect on the biomarker predicts a clinical benefit.
  - Example: LDL cholesterol predicts a reduction in cardiovascular disease.

### Types of biomarkers

- **Disease biomarkers**:
  - Diagnosis & prognosis
  - Early detection

- **Safety & efficacy biomarkers**:
  - Monitoring clinical response
  - Surrogate endpoints
  - Predicting outcomes/response

  - Pharmacokinetics

### Clinical biomarkers are critical for

- Identifying the right patients
- Optimizing dose and dosing paradigm
- Assuring safety of drug therapy
- Allowing ADME predictions
- Understanding population differences in response
- Supporting rapid decision-making in clinical trials
