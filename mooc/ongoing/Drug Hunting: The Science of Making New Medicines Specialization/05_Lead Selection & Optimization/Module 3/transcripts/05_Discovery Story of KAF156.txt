By the end of this video, you will be able to list some common steps that are involved in lead optimization. You will be able to identify structural changes in the anti-malarial compounds advanced through the program. Finally, you will be able to describe optimized properties in early clinical trial results of KAF156, the clinical candidate from the program. Now that we have described steps in the antimalarial program during previous videos in this course, let's review the steps again, as they are generally common to many different drug discovery programs. We started with a hit from a screening campaign, and explored structural modifications to identify structure activity relationships, SAR, understanding SAR around the core scaffold, a lot of improvements to the potency of the anti-malarials, ADME properties as well as early safety liabilities. Optimized leads from this iterative process were then studied in vivo, first for PK properties and then for efficacy in the mouse before continuing into the rat for additional PK and safety monitoring. If a lead did not show satisfactory activity in the in vivo studies, then further rounds of optimization and in vitro testing allow generation of additional leads for further study. The antimalarial project started out with an imidazolopiperazine hit on which four key sites of chemical substitution were thoroughly explored. Ultimately, core changes were also tested and led to the clinical candidate KAF156. Let's now look at how the properties of the series changed as a team moved from the early leads to KAF156. These charts track eight different properties. For some properties of the early leads, representative values from least optimized poor to most optimized good are shown. We can see the early leads had acceptable solubility and Lipinski Rule of 5 compliance through the testing of different structural modifications and using the assays we have discussed in previous videos, other important characteristics such as potency, in vivo efficacy, hERG liability, microsomal stability, clearance, and oral exposure, or eventually improved. KAF156 or ganaplacide is currently being studied in the clinic. The figure on the left shows the decrease in P. falciparum parasite count over time from a single 800 milligram dose. The chart on the right shows the CP time relationship for single dose patients. These clinical trials showed that KAF156 has antimalarial activity without serious safety concerns in adults affected with uncomplicated P. vivax or P. falciparum infections. The median parasite clearance time is 45 hours in patients with P. falciparum malaria, and even shorter at 24 hours in patients with vivax malaria. The human half-life of KAF156 in these patients was found to be 44 hours in line with the goal of the team had originally set. Additional clinical studies of KAF156 are in progress, including in combination with lumefantrine, in pediatric populations, and in studies to determine if KAF156 can prevent malaria. We have now listed some of the common steps shared by many lead optimization programs, reviewed these structural changes during the optimization of the imidazolopiperazine anti-malarials, and described the properties and early clinical results of the clinical candidate KAF156.
