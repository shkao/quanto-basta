By the end of this video, you will be able to define the idea of a biomarker. You will also be able to list different types of biomarkers that are commonly used in drug discovery. Finally, you will be able to outline how biomarkers are critical for supporting drug hunting. The US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, defines a biomarker as a defined characteristic. That is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions. In practice, a biomarker is typically something that can be measured in an animal or human using a minimally invasive approach. For the antimalarial case study, parasitemia is a biomarker for drug efficacy. A very small subset of biomarkers are referred to as surrogates or validated surrogate endpoints. These are biomarkers recognized by the health authorities as being predictive of a disease outcome. An example is LDL cholesterol in blood. Lowering LDL cholesterol is recognized as predictive of a reduction in cardiovascular disease. The importance of biomarkers for the success of drug hunting programs cannot be overstated. Biomarkers can be generally sorted into three categories disease, safety and efficacy, and pharmacology. Let's use our malaria case study to illustrate some examples. Malaria is diagnosed either by examination of a stained blood smear parasitemia, or with a rapid diagnostic test, RDT, in which malaria antigens are detected in a blood sample. Both parasitemia and detection of malaria antigens are examples of disease biomarkers. They offer diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. The RDT also provides early detection. Some biomarkers can fulfill multiple roles. Parasitemia can also be an efficacy biomarker, allowing either preclinical investigators or clinicians to monitor the response to a candidate or approved drug. In the antimalarial program, activity against the cardiac herg channel was a known safety risk. This activity can be monitored in vivo by quantifying the QT interval, which is a measure of time between different components of the heart's electrical rhythm. The QT interval is a safety biomarker. In preclinical animal models, this biomarker can be used to identify compounds that carry significant herg liability. In clinical trials, the biomarker can be used to monitor risks in humans, since it may be impossible to completely remove the herg activity from a potential antimalarial compound. Moving to pharmacology biomarkers, parasitemia is also a pharmacodynamic biomarker to correlate with pharmacokinetic endpoints. Creating the PKPD relationship critical for predicting human dosing. However, given this was a phenotypic program and the mechanism of action of the drug was unknown, investigators did not have a mechanism of action or target biomarker. This composed challenges for the team if sufficient drug exposure of a promising compound was achieved in vivo, yet parasitemia was not reduced. The team would be left to speculate on the reason for the lack of efficacy. If the specific target was known. A biomarker that measured activity against this target could allow additional valuable information that may guide further optimization and increase confidence in the approach. Biomarkers are also vital in the clinical setting. Biomarkers benefit the clinical research team in many ways. Such as identifying the right patients i.e., those most likely to respond to the drug. Optimizing the dose and dosing paradigm for the drug. Assuring the safety of the therapy. Predicting PK in patients with polymorphisms of ADME related enzymes or transporters. Understanding population differences that may be observed in clinical trials and supporting rapid decision making. While all these advantages are important, we can highlight the last one by returning to the earlier LDL cholesterol example. Clinical studies designed to demonstrate the benefit of a drug on cardiovascular disease can take many thousands of patients. And many years to measure an effect of disease outcomes, such as heart disease or stroke. Changes in LDL cholesterol however, a biomarker accepted to be predictive of the risk of these events can be measured in months. Significantly reducing the time needed to get an important therapy approved and available to patients. We have defined biomarkers and listed different biomarker classifications. We have also outlined how biomarkers support both preclinical and clinical research.
