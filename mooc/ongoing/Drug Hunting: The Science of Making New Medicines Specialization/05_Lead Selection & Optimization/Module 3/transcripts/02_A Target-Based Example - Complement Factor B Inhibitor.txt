By the end of this video, you will be able to contrast features of a target-based drug program with a phenotypic program, like the antimalarial compounds we have been discussing in previous videos. You will also be able to describe how knowledge of the target enables structural biology tools, like x-ray crystallography to advance lead selection and optimization. The antimalarial program we have been following is a phenotypic program. The molecular target of the drug was not known. The lead selection and optimization activities for potency were driven by cellular activity, more specifically the death of malaria parasites by an unknown mechanism. In a target-based program, the target is known and the program often benefits from the availability of the native or recombinant target protein. This opens up the advantages of using biochemical, biophysical, and structural biology assays to guide the lead selection and optimization efforts. The example we will use for a target-based approach is the discovery of Factor B inhibitors. Factor B is a protein with serine protease activity, and is part of the complement system, an immune system pathway. Development of a molecule that binds and inhibits Factor B has been an active area of research for treating a range of chronic inflammatory diseases. Let's discuss one of these Factor B programs. Through several screening approaches, each measuring either activity against or binding to the target Factor B the team identified Compound 1. Compound 1 had promising potency against Factor B and confirmed binding through surface plasmon resonance, SPR. Unfortunately, like the antimalarial compound, Compound 1 also had potential safety risks with activity against the cardiac heart channel and multiple adrenergic receptors. Core crystallization of Compound 1 with human Factor B afforded the core crystal shown to the right. The structural information of the core crystal allows visual identification of additional binding opportunities that may both improve inhibitory potency on Factor B and diminish off target safety risks. The bound structure of Compound 1 is in blue and teal. The S1 toward the bottom and S3 towards the top, those pockets were of particular interests to the research team. Modification of the basic amine and the imidazoline, which was likely linked to heart toxicity, was another point of interest. Unfortunately, replacement of the imidazoline with less basic derivatives led to a significant or in some cases, complete loss inactivity. The team then hypothesize that alterations to the naphthyl core may provide the necessary enhancements in potency. The naphthyl ring was replaced with an indole ring, which changed the binding orientation and afforded an additional strong hydrogen bond between the ligand and Factor B, as seen in the lower left of the core crystal with Compound 8. Despite the changes, Compound 8 had very similar potency to Compound 1. Guided by enzymatic activity data of Factor B and off target panels, the indole core was found to improve selectivity overheard and the Alpha-1 A adrenergic receptor. Replacement of the imidazolene ring with a piperidine provided sites for inclusion of additional substituents to improve binding. Two breakthroughs for the potency in this series involved. One, addition of a carboxylic acid to give additional hydrogen bonding interactions, and two, addition of an ethyl ether to the piperidine to fill the S3 pocket of Factor B. The optimized lead was LNPO23, the first reported highly selective inhibitor of Factor B. Note that all of the structural hypotheses and changes created by the team were enabled by the knowledge of the specific target, including development of assays and evaluation of x-ray core crystals. Contrast this with the antimalarial phenotypic program, which had to rely on data from a more complex parasites cellular assay where the mechanism of action of the compounds is not known. We have contrasted a target base discovery program with our phenotypic antimalarial case study, and highlighted how tools like x-ray crystallography can advance lead optimization
