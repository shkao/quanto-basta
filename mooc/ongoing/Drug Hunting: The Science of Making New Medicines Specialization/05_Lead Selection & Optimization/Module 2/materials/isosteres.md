A very common challenge in drug discovery is optimization of the PK properties of the lead compound. In some cases, a series of compounds may show adequate in vitro potency, but the intrinsic clearance may be too high. A high intrinsic clearance is a sign of metabolic instability, can lead to a short half-life, and poses a challenge to achieving efficacious exposure in vivo.

In these cases, the structure of the lead must be changed in order to improve ADME properties without overly reducing the observed potency. There are a series of exchangeable substituents, called isosteres, that medicinal chemists have discovered over time. Isosteric substitutions or replacements are often used specifically both to leave potency as unchanged as possible and improve metabolism or another ADME property.

To gain a sense of how isosteres are often used by medicinal chemists, read through the three examples below.

**Case 1 – sulfonylurea antidiabetics**

Sulfonylureas are a class of antidiabetic drug that increases the release of insulin from the pancreas. One of the first sulfonylureas was tolbutamide (**1**). Tolbutamide is an effective drug, but it does undergo somewhat rapid CYP-mediated metabolism at the methyl group of the benzene ring to form metabolite **2**. The half-life of tolbutamide is approximately 7 hours. The drug is often dosed 4-times per day, which is less convenient for patients.

Chlorpropamide (**3**), another sulfonylurea, was developed after tolbutamide. The main change in chlorpropamide is the replacement of the methyl group on the benzene ring with a chlorine atom. Because chlorpropamide lacks the methyl group on the benzene ring, chlorpropamide is cleared by the liver more slowly and has a longer half-life of approximately 36 hours. Chlorpropamide is normally dosed once per day.

The exchange of a methyl group with a chlorine atom is an example of an isosteric replacement. A chlorine atom is larger than carbon and occupies approximately the same volume as an entire methyl group. Unlike the methyl group, a chlorine atom normally resists CYP-mediated metabolism. Therefore, this type of replacement often has a low impact on potency, reduces hepatic clearance, and extends a molecule’s half-life.

**Case 2 – antimalarials**

In our case study on antimalarials, isosteres have also been used to improve the ADME properties of the original hit. The original hit is shown as compound **1**. Very early in the lead selection, the drug-hunting team recognized that the aromatic rings to the right and bottom of compound **1** represented risks of metabolic instability. Aromatic rings are often especially prone to CYP-oxidation.In order to address this metabolic risk, fluorine atoms were strategically placed on both rings. These substitutions are apparent in the final optimized lead (**2**).

Replacement of a ring hydrogen with a fluorine atom is a common isosteric replacement. The fluorine serves two purposes. One, fluorine is a small atom, only slightly larger than a hydrogen atom. Substituting a fluorine in place of a hydrogen introduces a minimal amount of additional bulk to the molecule and often has little to no impact on on-target potency. Two, the fluorine atom makes the aromatic ring less reactive to phase I oxidation. For these reasons, fluorine atoms can often be seen on aromatic rings in drugs. They are generally used to block metabolism and increase exposure.

**Case 3 – antihypertensives**

Many members of a class of antihypertensive drugs called the angiotensin 2 receptor (AT2R) antagonists rely on isosteric groups for their oral activity. Two AT2R drugs, eprosartan (**1**) and losartan (**2**) are shown below. Both drugs were approved in the mid-to-late 1990s. One key difference between the two molecules is the features shown at the top of the molecules. Eprosartan has a carboxylic acid, and losartan has something called a tetrazole ring.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7oc2yFGxSRWwxjhmXEMuUw_fbe4d485b3e34832bdfcf764d6960aa1_image.png?expiry=1729987200000&hmac=1qC-watP_3C63YPfJ3bLoyNAk0v8fNy5ZDOGSUl5GYo)

Molecules that contain carboxylic acids often undergo rapid phase II conjugation and subsequent excretion. Early research on AT2R antagonists found that properly placed carboxylic acids in the compounds improved potency, but oral availability suffered as the acids were too metabolically labile. A solution to this problem was found in the tetrazole ring as shown in losartan. Tetrazoles and carboxylic acids are both acidic and ionized at physiological pH of 7.4. Both tetrazoles and carboxylic acids, therefore, behave similarly when interacting with a drug target. Tetrazoles, however, are less reactive in conjugation reactions. As can be seen with eprosartan, not all drug-hunting teams incorporated tetrazoles into their AT2R antagonists. It is worth noting that eprosartan has a bioavailability of only 10-15%, while the bioavailability of losartan is 30-35%.

The use of a tetrazole in place of a carboxylic acid is another example of an isosteric substitution. The tetrazole maintains the potency of the compound while improving its ADME properties.
