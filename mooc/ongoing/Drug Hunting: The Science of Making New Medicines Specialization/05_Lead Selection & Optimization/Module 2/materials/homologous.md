A general approach for a SAR study is to find a position on a hit or lead, add different substituents, and measure the effect on the potency or efficacy of the change. A very common type of substituent is the addition of a simple carbon chain. Furthermore, chemists often synthesize a series of new compounds, each with one more carbon than the previous one. Such a collection of compounds is called a “homologous series”. A homolog is a compound that has one more or one less carbon than another compound. The creation of a homologous series of compounds can answer questions such as…Does addition of a substituent to the parent compound increase potency or efficacy? How long of a chain can be added without a large loss in activity?

The discovery of oseltamivir, an antiviral for the treatment of influenza symptoms, has the core scaffold shown below, and a number of homologues were prepared with the addition of a carbon chain on the ring oxygen (RO). The table below (homologue table) shows the potency of each homologue as an IC<sub><span>50</span></sub> value against influenza A and influenza B (ND = activity not determined). The discovery program intended to design a compound with high potency against both strains of influenza. Data for the compound in the table were reported in [Kim, Chuong U., et al. _J. Med. Chem._**1998,** _41,_ 2451-2460](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jm980162u) .
