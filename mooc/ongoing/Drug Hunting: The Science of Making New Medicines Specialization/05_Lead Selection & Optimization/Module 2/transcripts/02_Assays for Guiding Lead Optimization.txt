By the end of this video, you will be able to differentiate between two general approaches to drug hunting programs, target based and phenotypic based. You will also be able to describe the phenotypic cell proliferation assays that were used to screen for and optimize new antimalarial compounds.
There are generally two types of approaches a drug hunting program might use. First is the target based approach, in a target based approach, biochemical or cellular assays are developed in which the activity of compounds against the specific target can be measured. For example, if a target based program was seeking an enzyme inhibitor, the primary assay would be a biochemical enzyme inhibition assay. The second common type of approach is phenotypic based. Phenotypic research programs focus on affecting an outcome on a cellular, tissue, or organism level. An example of a cellular outcome would be rate of cell growth or cell division, a tissue level outcome may be muscle contraction. Phenotypic assays are essential for discovery programs that do not have a known drug target. It is possible, however, for a program to use simultaneously target and phenotypic assays. Particularly when achieving a desired physiological outcome, helps validate a compound or set of compounds already known to hit a specific target.
Antimalarial discovery programs, often use a phenotypic approach due to poor understanding of the ideal therapeutic targets. Microbial diseases, including malaria, are often amenable to the use of phenotypic assays. The outcome monitored in this case is simply the survival of the parasite during treatment with a test compound. These are called cell proliferation assays and rely on co incubating, a malaria parasite strain with erythrocytes along with a dye that fluoresces when intercalated with DNA. Parasite killing after exposure to a compound is quantified by a decrease in fluorescence. The phenotypic cell proliferation assays used in this antimalarial program were 3D7 and W2. The 3D7 assay is named after a PF strain of the malaria parasite, W2 is a pyrimethamine resistant PF strain. Given the importance of avoiding toxicity to human cells, a third phenotypic assay, Huh7, was also used. Huh7 relies on a human hepatoma cell line to measure potential cytotoxicity of the antimalarial compounds. These three assays align with three key scientific questions for compounds in the antimalarial program, does the compound have promising antimalarial potency? Is the compound active against drug resistant malarial strains, does the compound show low toxicity against human cells? In addition to identifying active compounds, assays also allow direct comparison of the activity of related compounds. As discussed in a previous video, the drug hunting team will study the most promising hits from a primary screen and synthesize variations. Derivatives or analogues of the hit to determine how changes to the structure of the hit affect its activity. Similarly, when one or more of the hit series is selected as a lead series, these assays can continue to be used to guide the optimization of specific characteristics of those lead compounds. While the assays we have discussed mostly emphasize antimalarial activity, the Huh7 assay can help determine SAR around cytotoxicity. Other assays are useful for SAR around admi properties of a molecule, all these types of assays are vital for selecting a lead.
We have now distinguished target based from phenotypic based approaches in a drug hunting program. We have listed three phenotypic assays used to test for compound activity in an antimalarial program as well as understand SAR and guide compound op optimization.
