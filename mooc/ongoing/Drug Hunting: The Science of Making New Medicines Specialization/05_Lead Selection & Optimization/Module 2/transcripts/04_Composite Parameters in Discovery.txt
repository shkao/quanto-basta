By the end of this video, you will be able to describe the role of composite parameters in drug discovery and list some examples of these parameters. You will also be able to demonstrate how the parameter lipophilic efficiency, LiPE was used in lead selection during a drug haunting program. Based on data on compounds during lead selection and optimization, the drug hunting team must compare and prioritize compounds. Researchers often combine data into an aggregated form called a composite parameter or metric. Composite parameters can often help the drug hunting team in decision-making. Composite parameters can provide value early or late in a discovery program. Here we have three composite parameters. On the left is MPO, multi-parameter optimization, which is most often used to prioritize compounds that penetrate the blood-brain barrier for CNS disorders. All the values listed here, molecular weight, clogP, and pKa can be calculated from a compound structure. So determining an MPO score requires no experimental data. Lipophilic efficiency or LiPE is calculated from biochemical or cellular potency and it compounds lipophilicy. Will discuss LiPE more on the next slide. Finally, early predicted dose calculations help prioritize late leads and are generally based on PKPD data. Lipophilic efficiency, LiPE is a composite parameter that is often used to compare hits or early leads. LiPE is calculated from the difference between drug potency or pIC_50, which is the negative log of IC_50 or p^EC50 and lipophilicity measured as either logP or logD. Note that drug potency is typically derived from a biochemical assay. In the antimalarial program, potency was derived from a cell based assay. This can add some complications in that the compound needs to be permeable to enter the parasite and get to the target. Higher values for lipids are desirable. In general, higher lipid values are achieved from compounds with a high pIC_50, that is low IC_50 value and low lipophilicity. In general, high lipophilicity is associated with low solubility, higher potency, and possible toxicity. The calculation of lipid demonstrates that drug hunters are often willing to favor compounds that are less potent via IC_50 if the compounds are also comparably less lipophilic. Here is an example of the use of LiPE to select a compound from a lead series. This example is taken from a different scaffold than we have been discussing in the antimalarial program. The team had to select between different Pepperdine substituents shown in the table on the core structure at the top of the slide. Based on potency alone, the middle compound would be the best with an EC_50 of 17 nanomolar. Based on lipophilicity alone, the top compound is the best with a low logD of 1.4. How did the researchers select the most promising lead? The LiPE value for each compound was calculated. Let's look at the top molecule. The cellular potency is 21 nanomolar, that is 2.1*10^-8 molar.
P^EC_50 is equal to the negative log of 2.1*10^-8 for a value of 7.7. 7.7 minus logD, 1.4, gives a LiPE value of 6.3. Calculation of lipid for other compounds gives 5.9 and 5.0. Based on the highest value for the composite parameter LiPE, the Pepperdine substitution pattern on the top was selected for the lead. Other parts of the molecule were subsequently further optimized and clinical candidate INE963 was ultimately advanced into the clinic. We have now described the importance of composite parameters in drug hunting and listed some representative examples. We've also demonstrated how lipids specifically was used in an antimalarial program.
