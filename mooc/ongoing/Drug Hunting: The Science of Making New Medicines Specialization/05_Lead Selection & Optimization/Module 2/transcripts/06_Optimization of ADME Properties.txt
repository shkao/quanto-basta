By the end of this video, you will be able to list some common in vitro assays used to measure ADME properties during optimization. You will also be able to demonstrate how these assays can guide the design of drug candidates. While the drug hunting team is optimizing the potency and efficacy of a lead, data on safety and in vitro ADME are also gathered. These are early assays that are routinely performed in almost all drug campaigns. Solubility is an important property. Oral drugs must have adequate aqueous solubility to dissolve in the GI tract for absorption. Solubility can also affect liquid formulations, such as an injectable. Solubility is often pH dependent. Oftentimes, the high-throughput solubility is measured at a pH 6.8, although this typically gives an optimistic measure of the solubility. Lower throughput methods use more physiological pH relevant media for an oral drug, such as simulated gastric fluid or fasted or fed stage simulated intestinal fluid. If a compound progresses into animal studies, more careful characterization of the solubility properties of the most stable crystalline form are performed. In challenging cases, when the inherent solubility of a lead compound is still too low for proper absorption at higher doses, optimization of the formulation can enhance solubility, and thereby improve absorption. Permeability, the ability of a molecule to cross a membrane also affects absorption, and even distribution. Permeability normally refers to passive diffusion across a membrane, but the process may be assisted by transporter proteins. One permeability assay is the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay, or PAMPA. Transporter proteins are not present in the artificial membranes of PAMPA. With optimized conditions and in conjugation with other permeability assays, PAMPA can be used to predict drug absorption from the human GI tract. One of those other assays is the Caco-2 assay, which utilizes an immortalized human colorectal carcinoma cell line. This cell line resembles human intestinal epithelial cells, and can provide additional understanding of active transport mechanisms for the drug in a bidirectional fashion, measuring both influx and efflux of a compound across the cells. When used together, these assays can help predict how and to what extent a drug may be absorbed. Metabolic stability assays predict metabolic degradation which affects oral bioavailability and half-life. A common stability assay involves liver microsomes, essentially internal membranes of liver cells that are rich in cytochrome P450 enzymes. The assays predict metabolic clearance called intrinsic clearance, and the extraction ratio, ER. Compounds with smaller values for intrinsic clearance and ER, generally have higher bioavailability and longer half-life. Let's now use these various in vitro assays to determine how structural features of anti-malarial compounds affect there in vitro ADME properties. We will skip discussing solubility since most of the study compounds had good solubility. In reading assays result, we will focus on matched pairs, compounds with just one structural change. For example, Compound 27 and 28 are the same except for the extra methyl groups at Position 8 in Compound 28. In the table are results from PAMPA and Caco-2 assays. We have two columns for Caco-2. The A-B column is for transport across the cell in the apical to basal lateral direction, as would occur with uptake from the GI lumen. This is called influx. The B-A column is for efflux or transport in the opposite direction. Differences between the column values can indicate that a transport protein is assisting a compound across a membrane. By comparing 29 and 31, we can see that in general, the N unsubstituted compounds, like 31, show a higher rate of influx across the membrane, particularly based on the Caco-2, A-B value. Compounds 27 and 28 show that addition of the methyl groups on the piperazine ring tends to decrease efflux in the Caco-2 assay. Metabolic stability assays included microsomes from three species, mouse, rat, and human. These assays showed researchers that the substituted analogues, as the N substituted or seven substituted analogs like 29, are predicted to be more metabolically stable than the unsubstituted compounds like 31. Note that the higher extraction ratios for 31 relative to 29 indicate faster metabolism, and effect that is seen across all three species. In another comparison, early in the discovery phase, the eighth position of the piperazine ring was suspected to be a metabolic soft spot and contributing to higher intrinsic clearance and extraction ratios. The similar ER values for 27 and 28, which has the eighth position blocked by two methyls, indicate that blocking the eight position does not have a consistent effect on oxidative metabolism in this in vitro assay. We have now listed some commonly used ADME assays and demonstrated how they are used by the drug hunting team to optimize leads in a drug program.
