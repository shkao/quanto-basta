By the end of this video, you will be able to recognize malaria as a neglected tropical disease as well as an unmet medical need. You will be able to describe the life cycle of the parasite associated with malaria. Finally, you will be able to list some ideal properties of antimalarial drugs.
Malaria is most prevalent in Africa, but encountered in parts of Latin America and Asia. The World Health Organization estimates that over 600,000 people died from malaria in 2020, with 80% of those being children under five years of age. Although effective therapies exist for malaria, emerging drug resistance is a constant challenge, creating demand for new therapies. Malaria is transmitted by the bite of an infected female mosquito. There are over 170 malaria parasite species, but only five infect humans. Three key malaria species include number one Plasmodium Falciparum, Pfalciparum or PF. This species is most responsible for human infections and death. Two Plasmodium Vivax or PV. This parasite is associated with malaria relapse episodes. Number three Plasmodium Berghei P berghei or (Pb). This species exclusively infects rodents, which is important because animal models of malaria are used to facilitate the discovery of human treatments.
The human phase of the malaria life cycle begins when an infected mosquito injects sporozoites into the human bloodstream. Sporozoites travel to the liver and infect human hepatocytes the parasite grows and replicates within a vacuole in the hepatocyte, this parasite stage is called schizont. The liver stage of the infection is asymptomatic, takes about a week and is the target of prophylactic drugs. P vivax parasites, unlike Pfalciparum, can form hypnozoites in hepatocytes, which are dormant, nonreplicating forms. Hypnozoites can survive in the human liver for months and even years, developing into a schizont at any point and causing malaria relapses. The biology of hypnozoites is poorly understood and an active area of research. Schizonts contain thousands of merozoites, which, when released into the bloodstream infect human erythrocytes patients then become symptomatic with the typical malaria symptoms such as fever, headache and chills. In some individuals, especially children, malaria can lead to death. Inside the erythrocytes, the parasite replicates asexually and forms large numbers of merozoites to infect more erythrocytes. Most antimalarial drugs target this blood stage of the disease. Some merozoites develop into gametocytes, which are the sexual form of the parasite required to continue the life cycle in the mosquito. When an uninfected mosquito takes a blood meal from a malaria patient, gametocytes in the blood are transmitted to the mosquito. Fertilization occurs within the mosquito, leading to thousands of sporozoites being formed to continue the infection cycle.
Early in a drug hunting program, researchers will typically define a target product profile TPP to establish both the minimally essential and the ideal properties of a new drug. The TPP guides the researchers to prioritize and deprioritized compounds and make decisions during the drug discovery process. An ideal drug to treat malaria would be active during both the liver and blood stages and block transmission of gametocytes to mosquitoes. The drug should act quickly to reduce the high parasite burden of an infected patient to alleviate symptoms. Given the many healthcare challenges in malaria endemic areas, such as difficult and infrequent access to clinical care and poor drug storage conditions, oral dosing is a key requirement. Ideally, the drug will also cure the disease in a single dose. To achieve single dose efficacy, the drug needs to be highly potent and have a long half life. Both factors contribute to ensuring the drug exposure is sufficient to cover multiple parasite life cycles, which is needed for complete eradication.
We have now introduced malaria as a disease, outlined the life cycle of the malaria parasite, and listed some optimal properties of a new antimalarial drug.
