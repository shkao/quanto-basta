By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to distinguish potency and efficacy. You will be able to list common types of target activity and recognize concentration response curves. What is pharmacology? Pharmacology is the science of drugs, which are often molecules and their behavior in biological systems. One aspect of pharmacology includes the action or changes a drug causes on a protein or in a cell or tissue. One way to classify molecules is according to their mechanism of action on a target protein, often an enzyme or receptor. Although there are many other examples of drug targets, molecules that bind targets are often called ligands. Most molecules that bind enzymes are inhibitors which shut down enzymatic pathways. Receptor binders are more varied. Molecules that bind receptors and turn on a pathway are called agonists. Receptor binders that turn off a pathway are called inverse agonists. Similarly, antagonist bind receptors and block the action of agonists. These labels are commonly used in discussions of drug programs to communicate the effect of a ligand on a target protein. Let's sketch some curves for ligands on these axes. For all these axes, the x-axis is the log of a molecules a ligand's concentration, and the y-axis is the effect. In these graphs, we will refer to affect generically as percent binding or response. Actual effects can be very specific. Examples include ion channel activity, enzyme inhibition or gene expression. First graph, for most ligand target interactions, the percentage of bound target protein rises typically in a sigmoidal relationship as log ligand concentration increases. That is a binding curve. Let's go to this second graph and look at an agonist. As concentration increases, the agonist turns on a pathway and causes a response. Again, it's a sigmoidal curve. Now let's go to the third graph and show a typical curve for an antagonist, inverse agonist or enzyme inhibitor. These ligands normally shut down processes, so we start at a high effect. As the concentration increases, the effect drops, again, a sigmoidal shape. An implication of these curves is that a ligand's binding to a target causes the effect or response. Let's again sketch a curve on this set of axes. Potency refers to the ligand concentration required to achieve an effect in as noted at the midpoint of the sigmoidal curve. Therefore, potency is read from the x-axis, and effect at a lower concentration equals higher potency. For binding curves, potency is reported as K_d. K_d is an equilibrium constant for molecule target interaction. Potency is related to a biological effect are noted differently. Agonist potencies are often reported as EC50 values. EC50 stands for the concentration required for 50% affect, the potencies for antagonist inhibitors, inverse agonists are reported either as IC50 values or the equilibrium constant Ki. The i is for inhibition. In contrast to potency, efficacy is related to the magnitude of a ligands response. Therefore, efficacy is read from the y-axis. This is important. The terms potency and efficacy are sometimes mistakenly used interchangeably, but these are two different ideas. Look at the two curves in the bottom-left. The red curve molecule A lies further to the left, so A is more potent than B. The dark blue curve B, however, gives a higher response, so B has a higher efficacy. That was a whirlwind introduction to some aspects of in vitro pharmacology with some terminology around types of molecules, target interactions, and the distinction between potency and efficacy.
