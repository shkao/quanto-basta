By the end of this video, you will be able to interpret plasma concentration time curves. You will be able to define the concept of pharmacokinetics or PK. You will also be able to list some types of laboratory tests that drug hunting teams use to predict the molecules PK properties. In this course, we emphasized drugs administered orally. To the left is an example of a CP time curve for a single dose of an oral drug. Drugs are commonly monitored through sampling of whole blood. The portion of the blood remaining after blood cells are removed through centrifugation is analyzed to determine drug concentration as CP, plasma concentration. The curve shows the characteristic rise and fall in CP as a drug is absorbed, enters circulation and ultimately exits the body. The understanding of all these processes is called
pharmacokinetics, or PK. To the right is a figure illustrating barriers to absorption faced by an oral drug. Swallow drug, the dose must first dissolve in the GI tract fluids. The drug must then cross cell membranes in the gut wall, after which it passes through the liver before reaching the systemic circulation. Both the gut and liver express cytochrome P450 enzymes that can break down drugs and drug-like molecules. A molecule that is able to both cross the cell membranes of the gut wall and resist extensive metabolism will have a high bioavailability. With a few exceptions for a compound to be successful as an oral drug it must have sufficient solubility, membrane permeability, and resistance to metabolism to reach the systemic circulation. Several assays can predict a molecule's pharmacokinetic properties. Solubility assays measure how well a molecule dissolves in simulated intestinal fluids. Membrane permeability assays test the ability of a molecule to passively or actively move across a cell membrane. Metabolic stability assays where compounds are incubated with cell-free preparations of liver and sometimes GI tissue can measure the rate of disappearance caused by metabolism. Collectively, these assays and as well as others are called in vitro ADME assays. ADME stands for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. ADME summarizes the ideas of pharmacokinetics. Solubility and permeability can influence the rate of absorption of a molecule. The upward portion of the CP time curve, this period is called the absorption phase. Once a drug enters the systemic circulation, it also undergoes distribution into tissues and is eliminated from the bloodstream. This period is called the elimination phase, and the process of elimination is called clearance. Common forms of clearance include hepatic metabolism in the liver, renal filtration by the kidneys, and biliary elimination through the gallbladder. A challenge in drug discovery is finding a compound with PK properties that maintain concentrations of drug high enough and long enough to exert the desired therapeutic effect. In other words, the needed exposure. A compound which is eliminated rapidly, may provide too little exposure to achieve a beneficial effect even if dosed multiple times a day. A goal for many discovery programs is to design a molecule that achieves the desired drug exposure by once-daily dosing. We have now introduced some of the challenges of designing an orally available molecule with an emphasis on measurable ADME related properties such as solubility, membrane permeability, and metabolic stability.
