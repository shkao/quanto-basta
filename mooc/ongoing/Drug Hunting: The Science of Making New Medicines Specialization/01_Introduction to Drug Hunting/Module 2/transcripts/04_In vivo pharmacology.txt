By the end of this video, you will be able to describe how in vivo studies confirm efficacy and connect compound exposure to efficacy. You will be able to explain the role of biomarkers in gaining insight into the action of a molecule. Finally, you'll be able to visualize dose-response data. Let's say we are exploring a compound that treats diabetes. The effects of some targets can be observed in naive animals, but often a therapeutic effect can only be observed in a model where a disease state is induced. One approach to studying the in vivo effect of our lead would be to monitor the activity of our lead in diabetic animals. Animal disease models are used to gain insight into treatments for human disease. How can we monitor a lead's activity? One symptom of diabetes is elevated blood glucose. Blood glucose is an example of a biomarker. A biomarker is a measurable trait that gives insight into the biological processes or responses to an exposure or intervention. We can monitor the effect of our lead on blood glucose levels or biomarker over time in diabetic animals. In doing so we're measuring the pharmacodynamics or PD of our compound. Furthermore, we can perform the study with different doses to determine what dose of our lead is required to achieve a therapeutic response. In other words, we will perform a study to generate a dose response relationship for our lead. That is our plan. On the screen are the results from our study. This graph shows time
resolve data from the study. We have five lines on the graph. The top line is the control or vehicle group. These animals received no drug, so glucose levels were roughly unchanged during the study. The other lines represent treatment groups. The animals received a dose of the lead compound. Doses are normally measured in milligrams of compound per kilogram animal body weight, often stated as meg per kg or mp keg. We can see that as the dose increases, blood glucose levels decrease over time. Based on these data and these doses are lead is showing both a promising biomarker change over time and a dose-response relationship. Very encouraging. Let's now take the data points at the end of the study and present them a bit differently to highlight the dose-response relationship, we plot these four points as percent reduction in blood glucose against the dose. Note that the x-axis is on a logarithmic scale. If we now connect these points,
we've created a dose response curve.
Dose-response curves often show a sigmoidal relationship. We can read the potency of our lead off the x-axis. As an ED 50, the dose required to achieve 50 percent of maximal response. Efficacy is read off the y-axis. While the relationship to dose is useful to understand, we also take PK samples during the in vivo pharmacology studies so that the CP time profile can be related to the efficacy we observe. This is important because it is the magnitude and duration of a compounds exposure relative to potency that drives the pharmacodynamic effect in vivo. Defining these PK PD relationships in pre-clinical species is part of what enables the prediction of the efficacious dose in patients. No discussion of in vivo research would be complete without considering animal welfare. Not only do pharmaceutical companies follow a rigorous ethical guidelines to ensure research animals are well cared for. They also adhere to the three R principles that is, replace, reduce, and refine. These three principles expressed the need to minimize animal studies and reduce possible distress of the animals and when those studies are required to maximize the value of each study. Finally, it is worth noting that well cared for animals provide the most robust and reliable data for guiding the development of a new therapeutic. Pharmaceutical companies have an interest in following best practices in animal husbandry. In vivo studies, which include monitoring biomarkers and PK provide valuable insight into the efficacy of a molecule, as well as understanding the relationship between target exposure and activity.
