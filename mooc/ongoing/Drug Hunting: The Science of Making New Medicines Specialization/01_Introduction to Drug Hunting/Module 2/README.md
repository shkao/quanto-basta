# Module 2

## In vitro pharmacology

### Learning objectives

- Distinguish between potency and efficacy
- List types of target interactions
- Recognize concentration-response curves

### What is pharmacology?

The science of drugs and their behavior in biological systems, including action at a target protein or effect on a cell pathway.

### Ligand-target relationships

Molecules that bind targets are called ligands.

- **Enzymes**: inhibitors (block enzyme action)
- **Receptors**:
  - Agonists (turn on a receptor)
  - Inverse agonists (turn off a receptor)
  - Antagonists (block agonists)

### Concentration-response curves

- **Binding curve**: % binding vs. log [L]
- **Agonist**: % response vs. log [L]
- **Enzyme inhibitor, antagonist, or inverse agonist**: % effect vs. log [L]

**Note**: Binding leads to effect or response.

### Potency vs. efficacy

- **Potency**:
  - X-axis (ligand concentration required for an effect)
  - Related terms: \( K_d \), \( EC_{50} \), \( IC_{50} \), \( K_i \)

- **Efficacy**:
  - Y-axis (magnitude of effect)

- In the graph:
  - Potency: A > B
  - Efficacy: A < B

### Concepts of potency and efficacy

- **Potency**:
  - Refers to the concentration or dose at which a molecule exerts its effect. It is related to terms like \( EC_{50} \) or \( K_i \). Potency is measured from the X-axis of a concentration-response curve, typically at the midpoint. Molecules with smaller \( EC_{50} \) or \( K_i \) values act at lower concentrations and are considered more potent.

- **Efficacy**:
  - Refers to the magnitude of the effect or response caused by a molecule. It is measured on the Y-axis of the concentration-response curve. In in vitro studies, efficacy can be related to inhibition percentages or enzyme/receptor activation.

## Pharmacokinetics

### Learning objectives

- Interpret Cₚ-time curves
- Define pharmacokinetics (PK)
- List laboratory tests that predict PK properties

### In vitro ADME assays

- **Solubility assays**  
  Measure solubility in aqueous buffers & simulated GI fluids
  
- **Membrane permeability assays**  
  Measure passive diffusion across membranes

- **Metabolic stability assays**  
  Measure rate of breakdown by metabolic enzymes

### Cₚ-time curves & elimination

- **Graph**: The plasma concentration over time shows a decline during the **elimination phase** after the drug has been absorbed. This phase represents the clearance of the drug from the body.
  
- **Elimination organs**:
  - **Liver**: Hepatic metabolism (breakdown of the drug by liver enzymes)
  - **Kidneys**: Renal filtration (excretion of the drug through urine)
  - **Gall bladder**: Biliary elimination (excretion of the drug through bile into the digestive tract)

The graph shows the transition from the **absorption phase** to the **elimination phase**, indicating how the body processes and clears the drug over time.

## Lead selection

### Learning objectives

- List key properties of promising hits
- Recognize the hit-to-lead pathway
- Outline the concept of structure-activity relationships (SAR)

### Finding the most promising hits

- **Library** → **Assay** (focus on **potency**) → **Hits**

A large compound **library** (e.g., 1,000,000 compounds) is screened through assays, and the most promising **hits** (e.g., 1,000's of compounds) are identified.

#### Example traits for evaluation

| Example trait for evaluation               | Description                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Potency**                                | Based on binding and/or functional activity    |
| **Selectivity**                            | Based on a panel of selectivity tests          |
| **Physicochemical properties** (circled)   | Solubility, stability, lipophilicity           |
| **Pharmacokinetic properties**             | In vitro ADME                                 |
| **No significant anticipated safety liabilities** | Based on chemical structure                    |

### Understanding Target Engagement in Drug Discovery

**Lead Selection Criteria:**

1. Bind the target
2. Show efficacy (concentration-response behavior)
3. Manageable safety risks and ADME properties

**Target-based vs. Phenotype-based Programs:**

- Target-based: Requires confirmation of target engagement.
- Phenotype-based: No known target or mechanism of action.

**Biophysical Methods for Confirming Target Engagement:**

- **X-ray crystallography**: Provides detailed interaction information between a target and ligand. Forms co-crystals for analysis.
  - **Limitations**: Not all targets can be crystallized; protein structure in solid phase may differ from the solution phase.
  
- Other methods: **NMR**, **SPR**, **Cryo-EM** offer alternative ways to confirm binding when X-ray crystallography is not feasible.

**Key Insight**: Understanding small molecule-target interactions facilitates lead optimization.

## In vivo pharmacology

### Learning objectives

- Describe in vivo studies
- Explain the role of biomarkers for monitoring activity
- Visualize dose-response data

### In vivo study example

- **Scientific question**: Does inhibition of target X reduce blood glucose in a diabetic animal model?
- **Approach**: Administer an inhibitor of target X in a diabetic animal model.
- **Monitor**: Blood glucose levels.
- **Outcome**: Dose-response relationship.

### 3Rs and animal welfare

The 3Rs:

- **Replace**: Use alternatives to animal models where possible.
- **Reduce**: Minimize the number of animals used in research.
- **Refine**: Improve experimental techniques to reduce animal suffering.
