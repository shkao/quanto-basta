# Module 1

## Interview with Pam Ting

## Drug discovery and development

### Learning objectives

- Distinguish drug discovery from drug development
- List the clinical trial phases
- Describe time & resources required by new drug programs

The US Food and Drug Administration maintains a series of short webpages that describe steps for drug research.

## Unmet medical need and key scientific questions

### Learning objectives

- List some examples of an unmet medical need
- Recognize the role of key scientific questions in a new drug program

### Examples of unmet medical need

- No existing therapy → Dengue
- Existing therapy is not very effective → Alzheimer’s disease
- Existing therapies but no cure → Diabetes

### Reducing drug program failure

- < 5% success rate in new drug programs
- Drug approval criteria = "safe and effective"
- Increase program success through improved scientific understanding of a disease.

### Key scientific questions – examples

- Will modulating the target affect the disease outcome?
- Can the target be modulated by a drug?
- Can the drug candidate be administered orally?
- Are the known safety risks acceptable to patients?

## Target selection

### Learning objectives

- Connect pathways, responses, & disease
- Recognize potential drug targets, such as enzymes & receptors

### Indications, mechanisms, & modes

| Indication       | Class/Mechanism            | Target                  | Mode of Action                  |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Acid reflux      | Proton pump inhibitor      | Gastric proton pumps     | Reduce gastric acid secretion   |
|                  | H2 receptor blocker        | H2 receptor              | Reduce gastric acid secretion   |

| Drug             | Target                     | Class/Mechanism               | Modes of Action                 | Indications                       |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Dexamethasone    | Glucocorticoid receptor    | Glucocorticoid receptor activator | Anti-inflammatory, anti-nausea | Asthma, immune suppression, arthritis |

## Assays & Screening

### Learning objectives

- Outline the process of finding active molecules
- List types of assays
- Describe how molecular libraries assist early drug hunting

### Assays in early drug discovery

Assay – any test that gathers data on a molecule’s activity

- **Binding assay**: Measures molecule-target binding
- **Functional assay**: Measures effect of a molecule on a target
- **Phenotypic assay**: Does not require knowledge of the target protein

### Library screening

- **HTS**: High-throughput screen
- **Library**: Collection of molecules, often with over a million compounds
- **DEL**: DNA-encoded library, very large libraries with tens of millions of molecules
- **Hits**: Confirmed, active molecules
