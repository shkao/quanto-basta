By the end of this video, you will be able to distinguish drug discovery from drug development. You will also be able to list the various phases of clinical trials. Finally, you will be able to describe the time and resources necessary to bring a new drug to patients. Drug hunting is an inherently difficult, costly, and risky endeavor. Programs typically start with thousands of chemical or biological compounds. May require 10-15 years for completion and have less than five percent chance of a program successfully yielding a new drug. With inclusion of cost of failures, which includes lack of safety or lack of efficacy, the price of bringing one drug into the market has been estimated as $2.6 billion.
Let's now examine the different stages of discovery and development. This presentation is a very general overview. Each drug discovery project is different and no single pathway fits every project.
The pathway on the screen shows general stages for creating a new drug from concept to registration. These steps are most relevant for a small molecule, also called a low molecular weight compounds. Small molecule drugs are often oral pill form drugs. Biologics, which are produced by biological systems and include for example, antibodies and the therapeutic proteins take a related yet different approach. Project are broadly divided in two parts. The discovery phase comes first and focuses on pre-clinical laboratory research. Once a molecule advances into human testing, it enters the development phase. Most projects start with an exploratory phase in which biological pathways associated with a disease or evaluated. The exploratory phase often requires identification of a key protein called a target that controls the pathway associated with the disease. Scientific data are collected to support and validate the role of the target. Next is a period of discovery during which assays are developed to test hundreds of thousands to millions of molecules for action on the drug target protein. The most promising molecules will progress into optimization. During optimization, a molecule structure will be changed to improve target activity and other properties while minimizing undesirable characteristics, including safety risks. Ideal properties and the molecules affect our confirmed in the pre-clinical stage. At this point, likely dosing levels for human trials are also explored. Following approval by a health authority, a compound starts in the clinic in Phase 1 trials. The molecule is tested in tens of healthy volunteers for preliminary safety testing and evaluating pharmacokinetics. As a side note, oncology clinical trials begin directly in patients. Because of the significant safety risks associated with many anticancer drugs, testing such molecules in healthy subjects would be unethical. Phase 2 advances to hundreds of patients with a focus on safety, confirmation of efficacy, and establishing ideal dosing. Phase 2 trials confirm whether a molecule can be dosed in humans to achieve a therapeutic benefit. Phase 3 or pivotal trials, may include thousands of patients. Phase 3 trials study of molecules, risk to benefit ratio, advantages over existing treatments and required prescribing information. If clinical results show a molecule to be safe and effective, the compound will be submitted to the regulatory authorities for approval. Even after approval, the safety or effectiveness of the drug may be further monitored in Phase 4 trials. Which may also include investigating efficacy and other patient populations or exploring new formulations. The process, while shown is linear, is highly iterative. Stages are often redesigned and repeated as the activity of the molecule is better understood. We are now familiar with the general steps of bringing a new drug from concept to patients. Not all drugs follow these exact steps, but these stages are shared by most small molecule drugs.
