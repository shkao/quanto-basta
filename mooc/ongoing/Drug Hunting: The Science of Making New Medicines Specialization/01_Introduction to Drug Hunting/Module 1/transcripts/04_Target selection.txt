By the end of this video, you will be able to connect biological pathways, responses and diseases. You will also be able to recognize examples of drug targets, such as enzymes and receptors. >> Here is a purely hypothetical pathway, we have multiple proteins, receptors and enzyme linked to different responses. Each receptor or enzyme, represents a potential point of intervention for a drug, a potential drug target. Assume we want to develop a drug for rheumatoid arthritis, in which joint pain is associated with inflammation. Each enzyme and receptor on this slide is directly or indirectly connected to the inflammation response. Are all these proteins equally attractive targets, no, only enzymes B and C are solely connected to inflammation. Receptor A, affects both blood pressure and inflammation. Receptor D and enzyme E, hit inflammation and clotting. The drug hunting team would likely select enzyme B or C as a target. The discovery team, would study the literature and perform their own laboratory research to validate and determine the best target. Let's assume the team picked enzyme C as the target of the proposed drug, the target defines the mechanism of action of the drug. The mechanism also determines the drug class. In our example, the proposed drug blocks enzyme C, and would be an enzyme C inhibitor, that is the drug class. The mode of action, is the effect of the molecule. The drug would be an anti-inflammatory, a drug's indication is the disease or condition it treats. In this case, our proposed drug would have an indication, of rheumatoid arthritis. Let's connect these ideas further. Let's start with an indication a health problem, acid reflux, which can be treated by different drug classes. Each drug class, has a different mechanism of action because it acts on a different target. One class is the proton pump inhibitor, proton pump inhibitors target gastric proton pumps. And their mode of action is to reduce gastric acid secretion. This mode of action, alleviates the symptoms of acid reflex disease. Another class of acid reflex drug, is the histamine 2 H2 receptor blocker. So the H2 receptor is the target. The H2 receptor blockers, have the same mode of action as the proton pump inhibitors and reduce gastric acid secretion into the stomach. Let's now start with a single drug dexamethasone. Dexamethasone, acts on the glucocorticoid receptor that is the target. Dexamethasone's class is a glucocorticoid receptor activator, that is also dexamethasone's mechanism of action. The glucocorticoid receptor is tied to multiple different responses, including inflammation and nausea. So dexamethasone shows many different modes of action, and is found use in the treatment of many different indications. Through these examples, we can see that one disease, one indication. Can be treated with many different drugs that act on different targets, and may have different mechanisms or modes of action. Likewise, some drugs, though they may bind to one target, are connected to multiple responses and are useful to treat multiple indications, multiple diseases. >> We are now familiar with the relationship of biological pathways, responses and diseases. As well as the associated idea is of drug targets, drug classes, indications and modes of action.
