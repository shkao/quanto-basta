By the conclusion of this video, you'll be able to outline the phases of clinical trials and describe what happens in each phase. The goal of a drug-hunting program is to see a molecule into clinical trials, and hopefully reach the patient as an approved drug. The first step for clinical trials is gaining permission to study the molecule in humans. The pharmaceutical company, the sponsor of the trials, submits an application to the health authority for the country in which the trial will be performed. In the US, this is called an investigational new drug or IND application. In many other countries in Europe, it is called a clinical trial application or CTA. The application includes data on the molecules, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, manufacturing, and the clinical plan. The responsible health authority will provide a decision on the application, typically, within 1-2 months. Once that approval is received, the molecule is now able to transition from the drug discovery stage to the drug development stage. A typical clinical research plan is divided into three phases of clinical trials; I, II, and III. Let's discuss some typical characteristics of these phases. But keep in mind, these are influenced by many study design considerations we won't cover here. In Phase I, the clinical candidate is studied in tens of healthy volunteers. Phase I is about safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the molecule, not efficacy. Subjects receive increasing doses of the molecule to gather data and inform clinical researchers for future trials. In Phase II trials, candidate drugs are studied in up to several hundred people with the underlying disease or conditions. These are patients, not healthy volunteers. Early Phase II trials, called Phase IIA, are often the first opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of the drug, in addition to monitoring, safety, tolerability, and PK. In Phase IIB trials, researchers then explore the efficacy of the candidate over a range of doses to help guide dose selection for the subsequent Phase III trials. In Phase III, the efficacy and safety of the drug is demonstrated definitively in large trials that can involve thousands of patients, and up to several years of treatment depending on the disease. These trials address questions such as whether there is an adequate risk-to-benefit ratio. Is a drug better than the current standard of care for the disease, and provide the basis for the information that goes in the drug label. Do all molecules follow this clinical path? No. But the pathway described is typical. Some molecules in therapies move through approval more quickly, because their early clinical trials show exceptional promise where the molecules meet an especially urgent, unmet medical need. Examples range from life-extending cancer drugs to new COVID-19 vaccines. Another clear exception is oncology drugs, which do not use healthy volunteers in Phase I because of safety and ethical considerations. Once the clinical trials are complete, all the pre-clinical and clinical data are compiled in a dossier, and submitted to the health authority for consideration as a New Drug Application or NDA in the US or a Marketing Authorization Application or MAA in many other countries in Europe. It can take up to a year or more for the application to be reviewed. If the application is approved, the clinical candidate will be an approved drug that can be marketed and made available to patients. Although approved, the drug will continue to be actively monitored for safety and efficacy. Post-approval trials, also called Phase IV, may also be performed to satisfy regulatory requirements or gather more information on the drug, such as testing a new formulation. Clinical trials for a molecule involve multiple stages in which evidence is collected to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a molecule in order to merit regulatory approval of the molecule as a drug, which can then be used to address an unmet medical need for patients.
