By the end of this video, you will be able to outline the steps involved in improving, optimizing the properties of a lead series to identify a drug candidate for possible advancement into early clinical development. You will also be able to list some key properties like safety, efficacy, potency, and pharmacokinetics that are optimized during the process. Before we jump straight into lead optimization, let's revisit how we got here. Potentially millions of molecules were screened for activity against the target. Out of that screen came a much smaller number of compounds demonstrating some activity referred to as hits. Those hits underwent confirmatory testing and some limited structural modifications on the path to make them more drug like, resulting in a limited number of leads series. The best leads series is put through an iterative cycle, a process called lead optimization. Structural modifications are made to create new analogs. The new analogs are tested for their properties. The results of these assays inform the drug hunting team which analogs should be made next, with the goal of further improving the properties. This cycle continues until a lead series is sufficiently promising or until the lead series is abandoned, because the series cannot generate a clinical candidate. Let's now talk about properties. This diagram shows a broad range of properties of leads that are measured and optimized through in vitro and in vivo testing of course, we see ideas like potency, binding, activity, efficacy. Pharmacokinetics are clearly important. Safety consumes the bottom left. Physical properties which can affect ideas like formulation also need to be considered. During optimization, molecules in the lead series will hopefully progressively fill a larger portion of this diagram as properties are improved, early molecules may not be tested for every property. Later structures will be more thoroughly scrutinized as compounds emerges score well against in vitro properties, those expected to demonstrate sufficient exposure in vivo will progress to in vivo pharmacology studies followed by additional optimization if needed. While just to representation. Finding the perfect molecule that fills the entire diagram is likely not possible, nor is it necessary as the optimal characteristics of a compound will differ depending on the disease target and other factors. Lead optimization is often a process of trade-offs where overall improvements may come at the cost of making one or more properties worse. Striking the optimum balance is a key challenge of lead optimization. A limited number of attractive compounds that emerge from lead optimization will progress to investigational toxicology and safety studies. Here is a case study for lead optimization. The final molecule is Gleevec or imatinib a treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The scheme starts with a molecule in the upper left. This molecule shows weak binding to the target, the BCR-ABL protein with tyrosine kinase activity. Adding an additional ring in blue gave a molecule with improved activity in a cellular functional assay. Additional groups were added to improve selectivity by minimizing protein kinase C activity. Poor selectivity could lead to safety risks through off-target effects. Finally, the group in green boosted solubility to allow oral absorption. Many more molecules and these were synthesized and tested, but these highlighted compounds show the type of progression followed during lead optimization. Note that the properties mentioned on this slide, potency, selectivity, absorption, and solubility also appeared on the previous slide. As you can see with Gleevec, a drug successfully emerging from the lead optimization process has the desire properties to interact with the target and modulate the disease it is intended to treat via the intended route of administration. We have now seen that delicate balance of properties managed during lead optimization. Since lead optimization is never perfect, decisions on any final candidate often require weighing the risks and benefits of each compound.
