# Module 2

## Preclinical PK/PD

### Learning objectives

- Link pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
- Describe two PK/PD models
- Relate PK/PD to dosing predictions

This image illustrates the relationship between **pharmacokinetics (PK)** and **pharmacodynamics (PD)**:

- **PK**: Describes how the plasma concentration of the drug changes over time (exposure).
- **PD**: Shows the effect of the drug relative to its dose (dose-response curve).
- The combined **PK/PD** model explains how the drug's concentration impacts its therapeutic effect over time.

### PK/PD models

- **Direct effect model**: The drug concentration (Cₚ) and its effect follow a similar time course, with the effect occurring shortly after the peak concentration is reached.

- **Indirect / delayed effect model**: There is a delay between the peak drug concentration (Cₚ) and the observed effect, indicating that the drug's effect takes longer to manifest even after the concentration starts to decline.

## Lead Optimization

### Learning objectives

- Outline steps for improving a lead series
- List key properties that are optimized

### Lead optimization workflow

- **Screening library** → **Hits** → **Lead series** → **New analogues** → **Evaluate properties**  
- This process is iterative, where new analogues are generated and their properties evaluated to improve the lead series in each cycle.

### Properties of interest

This radar chart highlights key properties considered during drug development:

- **Physical Chemical Properties**: Stability, solubility, crystallinity, lipophilicity.
- **Affinity/Selectivity**: Binding efficiency, binding specificity.
- **Activity/Efficacy**: Cellular activity, potency, mechanistic model activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics (PK)**: Absorption, permeability, distribution, metabolism, elimination.
- **Safety/Toxicity**: In vitro cardiotoxicity, off-target toxicity, on-target toxicity, in vivo toxic findings, unexpected phenotypes in vitro or in vivo.

These properties are critical for evaluating and optimizing lead compounds in drug discovery.

## Preclinical Safety

### Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of understanding safety in drug discovery
- List selected potential safety risks evaluated during drug discovery

### Common origins of toxicity

- **On-target toxicity**:
  - Arises from engagement of the intended target
  - Also called target-related, exaggerated pharmacology, or mechanism-based

- **Off-target toxicity**:
  - Arises from engagement of an unintended target(s)
  - A consequence of poor selectivity
  - Sometimes due to metabolites of the parent drug
  - Could result from a drug's physicochemical properties

### Examples of types of toxicity

- **Genetic toxicity/mutagenicity**:
  - Assessed through monitoring mutagenicity in bacteria
  - Screen called the **Ames test**

- **Cardiotoxicity**:
  - Assessed through IKr potassium channel binding and function
  - Screen often called a **hERG assay**
  - **hERG** = human ether-a-go-go receptor gene

### In vivo toxicology & safety screening

- **Short-term studies**: Require days to weeks
- **Long-term studies**: Can require months
- **In vivo toxicology**: Involves monitoring safety biomarkers (e.g., liver enzymes) and histopathological examination
- **Safety pharmacology studies**: Focus on cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems
- **Additional studies**: Address behavior, reproductive, developmental, and cancer risks

## Clinical Trials

### Learning objectives

- Outline the phases of clinical trials
- Describe features for each clinical trial phase

### Initiation of human trials

- Drug companies must receive permission to study a drug in humans.
- **US**: Requires an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.
- **Europe**: Requires a Clinical Trial Application (CTA).
- The application describes a molecule’s pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, manufacturing details, and clinical plan.

### Clinical trials

| **Phase** | **Test subjects**                         | **Focus**                                    | **Other information**                                  |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **I**     | 10's of healthy volunteers                | Safety, tolerability, PK                     |                                                        |
| **II**    | 10's-100's of patients                    | Safety, tolerability, PK & efficacy          | IIa – efficacy, IIb – dose ranging                      |
| **III**   | 100's-1000's of patients                  | Expand safety, tolerability & efficacy       | Risk-benefit, efficacy vs SoC (standard of care), drug label info |

### Approval as a drug

- Final approval requires review of a "drug dossier" with all pre-clinical and clinical information.
- **US**: New Drug Application (NDA).
- **Europe**: Marketing Authorization Application (MAA).
- Safety and efficacy monitoring continues post-approval.

## Competitive Intelligence

### Learning objectives

- Define competitive intelligence (CI)
- List types of competitive intelligence
- Describe common sources for information gathering

### What is competitive intelligence (CI)?

- **Definition**: The process of ethically gathering and refining information so that it can be used to make strategic business decisions.
- **Focus of CI**: On the external business environment and how our own activities fit in.
- **Purpose**: Gathering, analyzing, and deriving insights from CI is essential to develop robust strategies and successfully execute drug hunting programs.

### Primary & secondary intelligence

- **Primary CI**:  
  - Information obtained by speaking with people.  
  - Eliciting information is a process (or an art!) that involves building rapport and structuring a conversation.

- **Secondary CI**:  
  - Information obtained from published sources such as databases, press releases, company reports, literature, patents, etc.  
  - Secondary CI forms the basis for obtaining and interpreting primary CI.

### Examples of primary CI sources

- Vendors
- Consultants
- Financial analysts
- Members of the press
- Academic scientists
- Healthcare professionals
- Regulatory officials
- Employees of competitors

### CI must be performed ethically

- Competitive intelligence is both a **legal** and **ethical** business practice.
