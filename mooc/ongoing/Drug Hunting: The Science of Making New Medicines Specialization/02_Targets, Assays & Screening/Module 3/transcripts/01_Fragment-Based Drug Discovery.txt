By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to contrast the idea of a fragment library with a traditional library. You will also be able to list some common characteristics of screening of fragment library. Let's contrast the compound library of a pharmaceutical company with traits on the left against a fragment library. The main library likely has a million or more compounds. While not all of these will likely be used in every screening campaign, the library is regardless, quite huge. Many structures may be unique to the drug company. Members of the library tend to be larger structures and generally, molecular weights are greater than 300 and often upwards of 400 or higher. With a huge number of molecules like this, we need a high-throughput screening technique that can test all these molecules, or at least a sizable portion of them at a reasonable rate. Potencies of active molecules are around 1-10 micromolar. Now let's see the qualities of a fragment library. A fragment library may range in size 1000-3000 molecules, and the structures tend to be simple. The size of the molecules is generally less than 300 molecular weight. With such a smaller collection of molecules, the primary assay does not need to be high-throughput because the molecules are small, potencies will be weaker with a typical KD of 0.1-1 millimolar, 100-1,000 fold difference from the main compound library potency. A challenge in screening of fragment library is that with much lower potencies, each fragment library member must be tested at relatively high concentrations, even in excess of one millimolar. Detecting the activity of such weakly potent molecules requires compounds to be soluble in aqueous buffers at high concentration. Assays must be sensitive. Not many assay formats can deliver such high sensitivity. Some examples are nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, surface plasmon resonance, SPR, and x-ray crystallography, which we'll cover in more detail when discussing hit validation in a future video. As with a high-throughput screen, active molecules from a fragment library must be validated through the use of orthogonal and or counter-screen assays. However, unlike many high-throughput screens, fragment screening does not provide functional data, in other words, whether the fragment will activate or inhibit the target. This means the drug hunting team often needs to perform additional assays to confirm the desired activity. The goal of any screening campaign, including a fragment library, is to discover validated starting points for a drug discovery program. Screening a fragment library carry several advantages. Put simply, this approach can identify chemical starting points that were missed by other screening methods. Secondly, fragments allow the drug hunting team to sample chemical space in a broader and less biased manner than can be achieved using a compound library, which is often biased for specific targets those teams have worked on in the past. Next, fragments can be used to support in silico design of novel compounds, used to identify molecules in a large compound library that contain the fragment and then test those compounds for activity against the target. Another option is to try to combine two or more fragments into a single larger molecule through a linker or tether of atoms. If connected properly, the resulting molecule can have greatly improved potency. These latter approaches of building up a fragment to create a compound active against the target is often viewed by medicinal and computational chemists as an easier approach, then removing parts of a pre existing compound to achieve the same result. While hits from fragment libraries have low potency and the screening process presents some challenges, there are significant advantages to screening fragment libraries. These include finding chemical starting points that are missed by other approaches, sampling chemical space in an unbiased manner, and it being easier to build up a fragment to an active compound.
