By the end of this video, you will be able to describe the use of computational models and molecular docking to estimate the binding of a molecule to a target. You will also be able to list emerging technologies that are making computational methods in drug discovery more useful. On the screen is the general workflow for in silico screening. The key requirement is the availability of a crystal structure for the target. This can be a challenge because not all proteins form X-ray quality crystals. Fortunately, estimating the structure of a protein is often possible. If the amino acid sequence of the target protein is known, one can use other proteins with similar sequences and known X-ray structures to generate a structural model of the target protein. This technique is called homology modeling. The resulting structural model can be used in place of an X-ray structure to carry out an in silico screening campaign. A computational chemists will then use computational software to identify potential binding pockets in the target protein. Once these binding pockets have been identified, existing molecular structures can be computationally fit into those pockets to see if they might bind to the target, or novel structures can be designed and fit into the binding pocket. Fitting virtual molecules into virtual binding sites is called docking. Docking can be very fast and quickly identifies molecules that are predicted to bind to the target protein based on a scoring algorithm. Scoring is very challenging and not always accurate. All hits from a docking screen must be validated experimentally through traditional assays we have described before. While describing an in silico screen is fairly easy, successfully identifying hits that can be validated experimentally is quite difficult and requires considerable expertise from computational scientists. The methods discussed so far all require knowledge about the target protein. While the target protein is known for a target based program, a phenotypic drug program will not know the target. With advances in artificial intelligence algorithms in silico screening may be possible even if the target is not known. Sometimes a collection of active molecules can train an algorithm through machine learning. The resulting algorithm may be able to predict new analogs with increased potency. The use of machine learning is far from routine, but it does represent an area of potential growth for drug hunting. In silico screening can be a very useful tool for identifying potential hits for advancement in a drug discovery program. In particular, advances in artificial intelligence show promise for phenotype based programs with no known target, as well as predicting the structures of targets that have yet to be solved. All in silico hits however, must be validated through experimental assays.
