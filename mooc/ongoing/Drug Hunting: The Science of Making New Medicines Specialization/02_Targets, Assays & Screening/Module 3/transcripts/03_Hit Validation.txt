By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to define the idea of validation of compound target engagement. You will also be able to describe the use of x-ray crystallography as a tool for validation of target binding. The primary screen of a large library, greater than 1 million samples and even possible much larger, can afford tens of thousands of hits. Confirmation of ontarget activity through counterscreens reduces that number down to a 1000 or so. These compounds are believed to interact with the target either through binding or functional readouts. Hits still under consideration at this stage are most often validated in biophysical assays, designed to confirm and understand the binding of a compound to a target. Performing these assays requires both that the target protein must be available in a purified form, and that the confirmed hits are soluble well above their binding affinity constant, without aggregating during the validation experiment. These validation assays often help answer several key questions about a molecule's binding to a target, including does the hit bind to the target? What is the stoichiometry of binding? In other words, is the target bound by one or more than one molecule at a time? How quickly does the compound bind and release the target? These ideas cover the kinetics of binding. Similarly, how strong is the compound target interaction? These are the thermodynamics of binding. Where on the target does binding occur? What type of intermolecular interactions hold the compound to the target? Structural chemical changes to hits are used at this stage to strengthen or disprove hypotheses of how a compound binds. The resulting activity patterns are called structure-activity relationships, SAR. And can assist the drug hunting team in making decisions later in the discovery process. For example, how to improve the affinity of the compound binding to the target. X-ray crystallography is just one method commonly used to validate compound target binding. The structure on the screen is called a co-crystal and includes both a protein and a molecule bound to the protein. The protein is shown as a ribbon diagram to illustrate the general shape, not atomic level detail. The bound compound can be seen in the upper left in gray. The protein in this co-crystal was an actual target, complement factor B for a drug program. Pulling information from these structures takes some practice, but co-crystals such as this one, provide useful information for the drug hunting team.
Here is a view of the same co-crystal, with an emphasis on the interactions between the target and the bound molecule. The bound molecule has a darker gray color. The dotted lines on the screen show favorable interactions. For example, to the left we can see hydrogen bonds, blue dashed lines between the target and bound compound. Understanding these interactions facilitates the design of new compounds around the scaffold for creation of a hit series. This is a key step for lead selection and advancement of the discovery program. We have now learned about the need to validate the nature of compound target binding, with a particular emphasis on how x-ray crystallography can assist in understanding how a target and compound interact.
