# Module 1

## Interview with Scott Busby, Discovery Sciences

## Early Discovery Definitions

### Learning objectives

- Define terminology common to screening, assays, and early drug discovery

### Binding vs. functional assays

**Binding assays**

- Measure extent of molecule-target binding
- Report potency as Kₐ
- Kₐ = conc. required to reach 50% target binding

**Functional assays**

- Measure effect or response of a molecule
- Sample effects: gene expression, enzyme inhibition
- EC₅₀ or IC₅₀ = conc. required to cause 50% maximal effect

### Biochemical vs. cellular assays

**Biochemical assays**

- Do not use intact cells
- Used for many binding and functional assays (e.g., enzyme inhibition – a functional assay)

**Cellular assays**

- Involve intact cells
- Often required for functional assays
- More technically difficult than biochemical assays

### Roles of different types of assays

**Primary screen**

- HTS used on compound libraries
- Rapidly gives insight into potency

**Counter screen**

- Detects interference with the primary screen
- Helps eliminate false positives in primary screen

**Orthogonal assay**

- Measures activity differently from primary screen
- Confirms potency observed in primary screen

**Secondary assay**

- Confirms activity seen in primary screen
- Tests functional activity downstream of target

### Types of active molecules

**Active or primary hit**

- Molecule with appreciable activity in primary screen
- Potency tested at one concentration, often 1 or 10 μM

**Confirmed hit**

- Active tested at multiple concentrations to determine potency as an IC₅₀ or EC₅₀ value

**Validated hit**

- Activity confirmed through an orthogonal assay and chemical identity confirmed
- Can be a starting point for a discovery program

**Lead series**

- Series of related analogues with potential potency, efficacy, PK, and safety

## Target-Based Drug Discovery

### Learning objectives

- Define a drug target
- Contrast advantages & disadvantages of target-based drug discovery

### Target-based drug discovery (TBDD)

**Drug targets**

- Often a protein (e.g., an enzyme, receptor, or ion channel)
- Modulation affects biological pathways in cells/tissues

**Process**

- Target binding by drug → Altered cell/tissue response → Disease treatment

### Advantages of TBDD

- Measuring target binding is often relatively easy.
  - Faster testing
  - Faster feedback on new ideas
  - Faster development of active molecules

- Structural biology can reveal target protein shape.
  - Target shape informs possible drug shape
  - Faster development of active molecules

### Disadvantages of TBDD

- Drug target must be identified.
  - Not all diseases or unmet medical needs have been connected to a pathway or specific protein target.

- Target binding assays and structural biology studies can require large amounts of the target protein.

- Target binding must affect the disease in question!

### Targets and disease pathways

**Target → Response → Disease**

- Example: Enzyme A
- Target validation

**Alternate pathways**

- Disease may also be influenced by alternate pathways

## Phenotypic Drug Discovery

### Learning objectives

- Define phenotypic drug discovery
- List advantages and disadvantages of the phenotypic approach

### Phenotypic drug discovery

**TBDD approach**  
Target binding → Cell/tissue response → Disease

**Regulatory drug approval requirements:**  

- Safe & effective

**Phenotypic program:**  

- A phenotypic program monitors system changes.

### Advantages & disadvantages of phenotypic drug discovery

**Advantages**

- Earlier demonstration of a molecule’s disease-modifying activity.
- Less well understood diseases can be studied.

**Disadvantages**

- Safety risks related to the mechanism of action are less understood.
- Lead optimization may be slower without knowledge of compound-target interactions.

### Blended approach

**Target-based**

- Knowledge of the target facilitates optimization of the lead series

**Phenotypic**

- Identified promising compounds generate a biological response
