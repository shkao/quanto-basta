By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to define the idea of a drug target. You will also be able to contrast some of the advantages and disadvantages of target-based drug discovery. Target-based drug discovery begins with a target. What is the target? It is often a protein such as an enzyme, receptor, or ion channel, but could also be a lipid or nucleic acid, for example. These targets are components of biological pathway is found in cells and tissues. When normal pathways don't function as intended or pathophysiological pathways become active, the result is disease and associated health problems. Therefore, the premise of target-based drug discovery, TBDD, is that by binding to and modulating the action of a target drug molecule will in turn change cellular and tissue responses, ultimately affecting the disease state in a patient. Target-based drug discovery is a very common approach to searching for new drugs. It has many strengths, but of course it has weaknesses as well. What are some of the strengths of TBDD? First, measuring the binding of a molecule to many target proteins is often a relatively easy task. Such binding assays can be performed quickly with an efficient assay and hand. The team can quickly test changes to new molecules to determine whether binding has improved. The iterative cycle for new ideas is quick, so improvement tends to be rapid. Second, structural biology methods can give insight into the shape of the target protein. The shape of the target protein gives insight into the likely shape of molecules that will bind the target. This is another factor that accelerates progress towards maximizing target binding. What are the weaknesses? First, you must identify a target. Not all diseases are unmet medical needs have been linked to issues with specific pathways and associated enzymes or receptors. If you cannot identify a target, then target-based drug discovery is not an option. Second, to perform repeatedly the target binding assays, you will need relatively large quantities of the target protein. This may pose a protein synthesis and purification challenge. Third and perhaps most importantly, target-based drug discovery assumes that target binding will indeed result in an adequate response and effect a disease. Let's explore this limitation further. Let's assume a drug hunting team has identified enzyme A as a target. They are confident that enzyme A influences the response that will treat a disease. Here is a risk. What if one or more alternate pathways exist that also influences the disease? Even if you bind and block enzyme A, the other pathway or pathways may compensate and the disease state of the patient will be unchanged. This risk is real because our understanding of biology is not always complete. Anyone involved in target-based drug discovery is well aware of these weaknesses, especially this last item. Therefore, discovery teams work continuously to gather additional evidence that binding to a particular target will lead to a response that will impact a disease. This process is called
target validation and is an important step in de-risking the assumptions that are inherently part of target-based drug discovery. We now have a better understanding of both the strengths and weaknesses of target-based drug discovery. A very common approach used to find and refine biologically active molecules
