It is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Scott Busby, who is a scientist at Novartis. And so I'll ask Dr. Busby, would you please introduce yourself and tell us what your current position is with Novartis? >> Speaker 2: Hi, Erlinda, it's really nice to be with you today. So, yeah, I am an associate director at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, and I'm in the department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, sorry. >> Speaker 1: Okay, fantastic. So, could you tell us a little bit about your educational background? >> Speaker 2: Sure, I have bachelor's degree from Drexel University in Philadelphia, the degrees in chemistry. And I have a PhD in biochemistry from the State University of New York SUNY at Stony Brook. >> Ok great, and, if I recall, I think Drexel really has kind of a growing pharmaceutical type program. >> Speaker 2: It does, yeah, I can tell you that one of the major features that was really prepared me for a career in the pharmaceutical industry was the Drexel Co op program. There are a lot of universities that do co op studies for their undergraduate students. For me, it was really transformative, because, as I mentioned, I started college as a chemistry major. Organic physical chemistry, things like that. Really didn't think a whole lot about drug discovery or biomedical type research. But during my three semesters that I spent working in industry at a pharmaceutical company in the Philadelphia area. It was at that point that I kind of changed my entire tract of my career and really became interested in biochemistry and drug discovery and the development of medicines. And that really became kind of my passion and my career focus the rest of my career. And so I was able to then go back to school from those learnings and kind of change my curriculum and really gear myself towards a biochemistry focus. The second half of my college career, that prepared me for graduate school. >> Speaker 1: Okay, and so I'm guessing that interest in the pharmaceutical sciences definitely carried over and influenced you in your PhD as well, and later education. >> Speaker 2: Absolutely, yep, absolutely, it did. And that kind of work experience was one of the key reasons why I was accepted into the graduate program at Stony Brook. They were really intrigued by all the research and some of the things that I had been doing that was really cutting edge. Pharmaceutical industry research has always been cutting edge when it comes to technology and implementation of technology. And I had a lot of experience in that, and that really helped propel me into graduate school. >> Speaker 1: Okay, excellent, so, educationally, after graduate work, did you continue studies before going into the pharmaceutical industry? >> Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I did. I did a postdoctoral training at the University of Virginia. So during my graduate career, I was studying cancer pathways, and I was utilizing technologies such as mass spectrometry in my research, and I started to become very interested in that. I chose to focus in that area, which was actually part of the burgeoning proteomics field in the early 2000's. I was with Professor Don Hunt, one of the key pioneers around protein mass spectrometry in the proteomics field. And I did some research there on histones and pathways involving disease with histone proteins. And that kind of led me to my next position after my postdoc, which was at Scripps, Florida. And there I was a staff scientist for eight years at Scripps, Florida. >> Speaker 1: Fantastic, so could you talk a little bit about how are there any activities in a typical week or a typical day that sort of define a little bit more what you do at Novartis? >> Speaker 2: Yeah, sure, that's a really good question. I mean, one of the great things about Novartis and my role there is that I get to do a lot of different types of things, and it all really revolves around teams and collaborations. So I would say in a typical week, I work directly with my project teams on drug discovery projects that involves data analysis, coaching, mentoring them around the project strategy. Discussing results, next steps, things like that, and really just trying to kind of enable their work. In a way that allows them to kind of continue to grow and develop as leaders and for the projects to come together. I think one of the key things that we do at Novartis, it's all about collaborative teams. And to me, that's one of the best things about working there, because we have collaborators amongst our own department. We have a large department specializing in lots of technologies and biology and modalities of drug research. So there's plenty of people to connect, plenty of deep experts in areas, and it really is about connecting the right expert to the right biological problem for a given project at a certain time. And it's kind of an orchestra of collaboration that really works well. And so that's a major part of my job, working with direct teams. And then also lately, my career has evolved. So I get to work in portfolio management and help the department as a whole strategize on drug discovery plans for new targets and target validation. Working with our disease area collaborators, and really determining how to move our entire pipeline forward, for the preclinical research aspect. >> That's great, so if there's a representative number, what would be a typical number of teams that you would work with? How many projects would you typically support at a time? >> Speaker 2: Yeah, so I can tell you on the portfolio committee that I have, we have nearly 70 projects in all seven of our disease areas that we work with. So in a given year, we're helping all of those teams at various times, and there's always projects moving on to the clinic, and then we get new projects coming in. So it's a very large portfolio for sure. >> Speaker 1: So multitasking is certainly something you have [LAUGH] learned intimately. Are there any other skills that you feel have come in handy for your position? >> Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I mentioned collaboration. I think that's a really key area. So being able to collaborate with people, and a lot of times it's balancing what you need for given projects. And everybody has different opinions with strategy and approaches. So it's really important to be a good listener and to keep up with the latest literature that's out there. I mean, that's one of the other great things I like about Novartis. We have such a robust research group, and we have many collaborations, both within NIBR as well as external collaborations. To make sure that we're staying cutting edge and we develop a lot of cutting edge technologies inside of Novartis. I think another aspect is really important is what we call prototype mindset. A prototype mindset is really to try to quickly achieve a go no go kind of decision on something and really design something that you can do, a rapid proof of concept. And we can achieve that quick go no go because it's just as important to rapidly fail at a concept or an approach as it is to succeed at one. And the real key is to design the right experiments. And the prototype is really just sort of an approach that if successful, we would be able to then broadly apply it to a number of different disease areas to really advance many things at the same time. So you want to get the most bang for the buck when it comes to these new ideas and innovations. >> Speaker 1: Yes, and I would say also when there are failures, how do you extract as much information from those failures to help maybe the next prototype you're trying to design? >> Speaker 2: Absolutely, that's a great way to put it. Lessons learned is a key feature so that we can move everybody forward, especially in a large organization where we have so many projects going on. It's a real important key that we communicate those things across the whole organization so that everybody can learn from them and we can rapidly move things forward in parallel. >> Speaker 1: It does seem that as you talk about this environment, you bring skills and you brought your education and training to Novartis. But one skill you also have is to continuously learn and incorporate new information as you operate on the cutting edge of developing new therapeutics. >> Speaker 2: Absolutely, I mean, I think that's, for me, personally, being someone with broad experience, but also broad interests in many different areas. That's why a large company like Novartis, for me, is very attractive, because there's so many things that we're involved in. so many disease biologies, so much technology, so much innovation, that we're constantly learning and evolving. I mean, my career now at Novartis, I've been there nearly 10 years, is very different than it was when I first joined back in 2012. And that's the great part of it for me. It's like having a continually evolving job that is never the same. And not only do you expand and grow your network and your capabilities and your expertise. But science itself is changing so rapidly and so many new technologies and so many new drug modalities that are coming to fruition. It's really exciting because we can bring therapies to patients that were not even imaginable when I started at Novartis, and that's really exciting. >> Speaker 1: One thing I wanted to bring out more was your experience in mass spec. That's just one of those tools that people are just learning to apply in so many different ways. And it's yielding so much information, and it's quick, and it has incredible resolution, potentially when coupled with separation technologies. And it's really just been a field that, as an organic chemist, when I came through organic chemistry just seemed kind of like a dead end of great. You can smash a molecule and pick up the pieces, who cares? But it's just so much more than that now. >> Speaker 2: Basically, it keeps evolving. And I started with proteomics and studying all these signaling pathways through mass spec. It's a really great way to do that. I mean, there were a lot of aspects in the lab that I came from, in Don Hunt's lab, looking at MHC peptide presentation and neoantigen tumor antigen presentation. That now have led to personalized vaccines and things that are in the clinic, as we speak, helping patients. So all that early research in proteomics is really coming to fruition. And in my particular experience, I was involved a lot in structural mass spectrometry. So when I was at Scripps, we looked at protein dynamics and how proteins come together. And we could look at that through a technique called hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spec, and we did that. And now we have native mass spectrometry, which lets us look at huge complexes of proteins coming together as much over a million Daltons in sizes that were like unfathomable before. And now we can look at that and we can look at protein, interactions and create assays to disrupt it or to enhance it. There's a ton of great things that are happening in mass spec, for sure. >> Speaker 1: You have these different fields that are technologically advancing, and one has to wait on another. The analytical chemistry, to catch up, and then robotics has to catch up, and each advance can lead to a different breakthrough. And that's exciting to work in an area that's truly dynamic. >> Speaker 2: It is, and my department itself is a great sort of central hub of all of that, because chemical biology and the whole idea of what we can do with innovation and technologies. And we bring together all of these different modalities and technologies like mass spec. We develop mass spec screening at Novartis that a few companies do, but most of them don't, where we do high throughput screening, 384. Well, assays using these new rapid fire platforms, they're not that new now, but they're becoming now 1536 capable. We're getting some new technologies there, but the instrumentation for native mass spec, just in the last few years. A commercial instrument came out about two years ago that lets us do these incredible protein complexes that are gigantic, and we can do so much with that. When it comes to drug discovery and understanding, mechanism of action and all these other aspects, it's pretty exciting like you said. >> That's great, as everyone grows and learns more, are there any particular challenges that stand out that you might consider to be the next frontiers that are achievable? >> Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a really good question. I think there are a few different things that come to mind, I guess, when we talk about challenges, for me, sort of in the screening assay development, early lead discovery area. Really finding the most biologically relevant assays, disease models that are truly predictive of the disease that you're trying to target, that's been the most challenging. Whether it's a target based assay or even phenotypic screening, that you just want to make sure that what you're looking at is really the causative agent of the disease. And you're really nailed down the right pathway or the right target. So to understand that it takes a combination of deep biology research along with novel assay development, and at Novartis, we do both of those things, and we have expertise in all of those areas. And really bringing those things together, it can be really challenging, and it continues to be challenging. But it's very rewarding when you can continue to iterate and understand the biology and then make those changes where you're really being more predictive in your preclinical research. And it's really where the two come together. And it also involves reading and knowing the external fields and working with our collaborators, both inside and outside, to really keep challenging and pushing that envelope, so that's one area. For me, another part is identifying novel modalities for these next generation of targets. I mean, I mentioned that a few minutes ago. There have been so many changes in the last 10 years when it comes to targeting RNA or you have protecs or many different things that people are now deploying. Because more and more the most important targets for disease were considered undruggable in the past, and in some cases, they might still be considered undruggable. They're not enzymes. They don't have active site pockets that you can modulate or enzymatic activity that you can change. So there's lots of different new approaches, new ways of thinking. Cell and gene therapies, such as the CAr T therapy that Novartis has pioneered with Kim Raya and other things. These are the aspects that we keep having to identify and figure out new approaches, new strategies. Because most of the really difficult targets are still out there, and we have to find new ways to get at them. So that's been a challenge. And I would say, finally, it's resistance to therapies. I mean, tumor resistance, and just sort of in general, resistance, understanding what causes it and then trying to keep strategizing so that we can defeat it. I think it's everyone's challenge, and that continues to be a challenge in our field. >> Speaker 1: Well there, certainly, there's plenty more work to be done, it sounds like. >> Speaker 2: Absolutely. >> Speaker 1: Well, Dr. Busby, thank you so much for being willing to sit down for this interview and share your background and experiences with the participants in this course. >> Speaker 2: Is my pleasure, thanks a lot for chatting, and it was great. Thanks again. >> Speaker 1: Absolutely, take care. >> Speaker 2: You, too.
