By the end of this video, you will be able to list four common types of libraries used in drug discovery today. You will also be able to contrast some of the advantages and disadvantages of each type.
Every larger pharmaceutical company has a compound collection. When chemists make new molecules, they submit a sample of the material to be cataloged into the company library for future reference and use in screening campaigns. If company A buys company B, company B's full compound collection will be added to company A's collection. Major pharmaceutical companies can have collections of well over a million molecules, often several million. An advantage is that the company already has these molecules on hand. A disadvantage is that the library members tend to sample drug like molecular space in a nonuniform manner. If a company has a history of researching antidiabetics or antidepressants, then the main library may be overrepresented in those areas. While other regions of molecular space may be relatively underrepresented. Screening campaigns may miss hits from these underrepresented regions.
Since many molecules in a company compound collection are likely similar to others in the collection, representative subsets of the library may be created to conserve resources and allow more rapid screening. Subsets could represent chemical diversity in the full collection desired physicochemical properties, or compounds with activity against known targets such as GPCRs or protein kinases. These filtered collections may shorten the time for screening, but the lack of full coverage of the entire collection risks missing unique structures that may be hits.
A fragment library consists of several thousand molecules with roughly 15 atoms carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, the halogens, phosphorus and sulfur. These fragments are about half the size of a typical oral drug. In the upper right corner is a hit that arose from screening a traditional compound library for a complement inhibitor, it has 31 larger atoms. In contrast, a hit from screening a fragment collection against the same target is shown In the lower right, it has just 18 larger atoms. The logic behind screening fragments is that these fragments are parts of many, many molecules in potential drug space. So a single fragment potentially provides an indication of activity for many molecules in drug space. Additional fragments give further glimpses of activity across the space. It's been postulated that a library of just a few thousand fragment sized molecules can sample all of drug space. An advantage to this fragment based drug discovery, FBDD approach is that a small library can be used in screening. A disadvantage is that hits from a fragment screen are normally less potent than drug sized molecules, requiring different screening technologies that will detect binding and often don't provide any functional information.
DNA-encoded libraries, DELS, are truly massive libraries of hundreds of millions or even billions of molecules. Each molecule is attached to a characteristic strand of DNA that acts like a barcode. Molecules that show activity in a screen are identified through sequencing the attached DNA barcode. DELS are relatively inexpensive to synthesize and provide incredible diversity for sampling druglike space. Some disadvantages include challenges in the chemical synthesis, while minimizing damage to the DNA strand and confirming the identity and potency of the hits requires more effort than other libraries.
While each type of library has its own advantages, none is universally better than another. Each should be viewed as a tool for discovering hits through a screening program. The best tool will depend on challenges posed by each drug discovery program, and often multiple libraries are screened in parallel in drug hunting programs.
