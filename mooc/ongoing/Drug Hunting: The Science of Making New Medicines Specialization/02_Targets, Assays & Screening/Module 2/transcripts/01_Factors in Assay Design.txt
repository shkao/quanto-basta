By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to list some design factors for robust assays. You will also be able to define Z-factor, which is a quantitative metric for determining the reliability of an assay's results. Assays are often performed in microtiter plates. Traditionally, microtiter plates have 96 separate wells for the performance of assays and an 8 by 12 array. With advancements in robotics and automation technology, the miniaturization of plates to 384 wells in a 16 by 24 format, and even to 1,536 wells with a 32 by 48 arrangement are common. Miniaturization allows a screening campaign to use fewer reagents, less target protein, and smaller samples of material from compound libraries. Volumes in each well shrink quickly as the number of wells increases. The working volume for each well in a 96-well plate is 150 microliters, 25 microliters for 384, and just 5-6 microliters for a 1,536-well plate. Higher-density plates have made the screening of large compound libraries much more feasible. These are all advantages. Miniaturization also tests the limits of reproducibly measuring and dispensing small volumes of liquids into each tiny well. Assays are performed with controls that ensure that the assay is behaving in a reliable, reproducible manner. A common assay performance metric is the Z prime factor. The Z prime factor is calculated from results based on controls and ranges in value from approximately zero up to one. There are maximum or active controls and minimum or neutral controls in the assay. A minimum control could be a well in which all reagents and media are added with inclusion of an inhibitory compound to suppress any signal. A maximum control would be a well with all materials and a molecule with known activity. Molecules used as active controls are examples of tool compounds, which are often compounds identified from the literature with promising potency and efficacy, but likely poor pharmacokinetic or safety concerns. On the screen, we have results from two assays. The left chart shows an assay with a low Z prime factor. Although this assay has large signal to background, which is related to the magnitude of the y values, the results from the maximum active controls are very scattered. The right chart has a higher, more favorable Z prime factor. Yes, the overall signal to background is a bit lower, but both the active and neutral controls have much less scatter. With the equation at the bottom of the screen, we can calculate an assay's Z prime factor from the mean's Mu and standard deviations Sigma of the results of the active and neutral controls. Z prime scores of 0.5 or greater are ideal for a high throughput assay. In essence, you want a large difference between the mean scores of the two controls with small standard deviations. Factors that are relevant to the results of the controls and test wells include the signal-to-background and signal-to-noise. Signal-to-background is the ratio of the maximum quantifiable signal to the average background signal. Signal-to-noise is defined as the ratio of the mean signal value divided by the signal standard deviation. Because of the influence of signal-to-background and signal-to-noise on an assay's Z prime factor, researchers prefer assay technologies that maximize both signal-to-background and signal-to-noise. For this reason, many assays rely on fluorescence, which provides a high assay signal and luminescence, which provides very low background noise levels as methods to develop assays for high-throughput screens. Through paying careful attention to implementation of proper controls, establishing data reliability, and maximizing efficiency in the assay design, scientists are successfully able to rapidly and confidently screen large libraries of molecules in the early stages of a discovery program.
