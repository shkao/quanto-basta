By the end of this video, you will be able to identify potential problems that can appear in the primary assay. You will also be able to list types of assays that can help confirm results from the primary assay. Many primary assays are designed so the action of the molecule on a target is coupled to something called a reporter enzyme. The reporter enzyme then generates a signal that can be detected. Enzymes called, Luciferases are commonly used as reporter enzymes. Luciferases act on substrates called luciferins to generate a luminescent light producing signal. Luciferases can often be adapted into assay designs. Problems in the assay can arise if a molecule from the compound library inhibits luciferase, the reporter enzyme, so that no light signal is generated. Depending on the design of the assay, luciferase inhibitors can be false positives or false negatives. Orthogonal assays and counterscreens can help identify these problems. One solution to our problem is an orthogonal assay. Orthogonal assays use a different method of activity detection from the primary assay and validate results from the primary assay. An orthogonal assay may redesign the assay with a different member of the luciferase enzyme family or use a reporter enzyme that generates a fluorescent signal. Different luciferase family members generally are not inhibited by the exact same structures. Another approach would be to directly detect the formation of products or molecules that arise from target binding. For example, by LC-MS liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. These molecules could be enzyme reaction products or signal molecules. Truly active molecules should give mostly positive results in the primary and orthogonal assays. A counterscreen assay does not check for activity on the target. A counterscreen attempts to directly test whether the molecule is interfering with the mechanics of the assay. For example, an assay may directly test for inhibition of a luciferase enzyme. Therefore, the desired result for a molecule in a counter screen is to show no activity, no inhibition of luciferase. Note that, logically speaking, a molecule that inhibits a luciferase enzyme may also act on the target protein being tested in the screen. Therefore, just because a molecule shows positive activity in a counter screen, that molecule still may be cautiously included in the pool of active molecules for further study. But requires orthogonal assay validation. Pan-assay interference compounds or.
Pains are molecules that affect the intended target in an undesirable manner and will show activity even when an orthogonal technology is tested. Pains are also called frequent hitters, non-specific binders, or nuisance compounds. Pains are often chemically reactive molecules that covalently bind to proteins, including the intended target and enzymes like luciferase. Covalent binding in a non-specific manner is generally not exploitable for drug discovery. Pains can often be identified through counterscreens. There are many techniques for confirming the results of the primary assay following counterscreens and orthogonal assays, including assays that directly test for target binding, such as biophysical assays. We have now covered possible problems that can arise in the primary assay and how counterscreens and orthogonal assays can help identify true actives from the screening library.
