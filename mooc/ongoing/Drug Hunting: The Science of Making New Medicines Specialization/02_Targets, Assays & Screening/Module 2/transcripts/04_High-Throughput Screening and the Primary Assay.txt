At the conclusion of this video, you'll be able to list some factors that are often considered at the start of a screening campaign. You will also be able to describe some aspects of high-throughput screening, and the primary assay. Drug hunting often starts with large libraries of molecules. Compound libraries are far more valuable for finding act of molecules if the library can be tested rapidly. The rapid testing of a library of molecules is called high-throughput screening, and is defined as the testing of 10,000-100,000 compounds per day, and accomplished with automated processes. A high-throughput screen, or HTS, often kicks off a drug discovery campaign. Rapid screening relies on automation through robotic technology to perform an assay both quickly, and reproducibly. Robotics are involved in all aspects of the process. Robots retrieve the compounds from library storage. Robots create diluted solutions of each molecule. Robots prepare microtiter plates, with the required reagents for the assay. Within an area about the same as a three by five inch index card, a plate can contain up to 1,536 wells for testing molecules in the assay. Some of these are negative and positive controls, but most are used to test the activity of library members. A significant challenge in performing a high-throughput screen is miniaturization of the process to dispense the tiny volumes required, for such high density microtiter plates. As the assay is performed, the plates are transferred to plate readers to record the outcome of the assay. The primary assay used in a high-throughput campaign must be amenable to automation, and miniaturization. Assays used in a high-throughput screen, can be either biochemical assays or cell-based assays. Both assay types can be designed to measure either binding between a molecule, and target protein, or function of the target protein. The assay must be relatively simple to perform, well-designed, and thoroughly tested for accuracy, and precision. Biochemical and cell-based assays are typically performed in an aqueous pH buffered medium. The library member, and organic molecule is often added at a relatively high concentration in an organic solvent, most often DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide. The assay must be able to tolerate low concentrations, typically less than 1% of DMSO, without interference with assay function or the measured endpoint. Because a high-throughput screen requires testing potentially hundreds of thousands or even millions of molecules, each library member is tested at just one concentration. A common screening concentration, maybe 10 micromolar or one micromolar, depending on the expected difficulty of discovering active molecules, or considerations related to solubility, or potential cytotoxicity. The type of library being screen can also influence the concentration of the assay. Most molecules will show very low efficacy at the tested concentration. But some may show observable target binding. These are the actives. A common cutoff is to select compounds showing an activity that is greater than three standard deviations of the untreated wells, which may amount to only 0.1% of the library for further study. So if the library molecules show a normal distribution of activity in the assay,
we can select the top 0.1% of the library based on statistical measures. Note that the top 0.1% of a million member library, is still 1,000 compounds. Only once the hits have been further tested and confirmed, will they be considered confirmed hits, and represent chemical starting points in a drug discovery program. The primary assay is used in the initial high-throughput screen to identify molecules in a compound library with promising target binding properties.
