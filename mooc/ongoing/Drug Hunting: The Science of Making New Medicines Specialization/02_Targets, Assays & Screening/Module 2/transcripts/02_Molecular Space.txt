By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to explain the concept of molecular space. You will also be able to connect the relative relationships of hits, leads, and drugs. On the screen is a large box. This box represents a molecular space. All molecules with the size of a typical oral drug. This is a potential oral drug space. Back in 1996, Wang Guida estimated that the number of druglike molecules was 10 to the 63. Guida defined Drug-like as a molecule with up to 30 atoms taken from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, the halogens, sulfur, and phosphorus. That number does not include hydrogen atoms. 30 of these atoms is roughly the size of a typical drug that likely has solubility and permeability properties to allow oral absorption. This number of molecules ten to the 63 is immense. Just one of each of these molecules would have a mass greater than everything in our solar system. What can we learn from visualizing molecular space as an empty box? Well, let's fill the box. Let's assume that we are developing a new diabetes drug. Hypothetically, the entirety of drug space will have regions in which we will find molecules that have promising activity against our target. These regions might be what we call hit spaces.
And they are defined by the outer regions of these ovals. Some of these hit spaces might contain molecules that merit being leads. These are smaller regions within the hit spaces. These would be Lead spaces.
Some lead spaces may contain molecules safe and effective enough to be approved as drugs. These are our small blue dots.
Let's now think about developing an asthma drug. Let's show this in red. We will again have hit spaces, smaller lead spaces, and even smaller drug spaces. Notice that our hit lead drug spaces are different for the different diseases. Different diseases may have different targets, and different targets will bind to molecules in different areas of drug space. Although not shown here, some targets may mediate multiple diseases, so the drug spaces for those diseases would overlap. When considering a screening campaign to find hits for a new drug program, we want our screening library to include molecules. These additional black dots represent possible library molecules that are scattered throughout drug space. To increase our chance of finding hits connected to many leads and potential drug spaces.
Let's refresh our molecular space and think about how we view molecular space when searching for hits in a screening campaign, and even peek ahead to lead selection and lead optimization. Let's assume we have two different hit spaces,
Each of which includes potentially millions or even billions of molecules. Within these hit spaces are smaller regions of possible leads. Maybe one lead space actually includes possible drugs. Again, our library molecules are the black dots. The goal of a screening campaign is to test molecules through the primary assay. Hopefully, some of these screened molecules will be located within these two hit spaces. Of course, many tested molecules will fall outside these regions and show no activity. Once the activity of these hits is confirmed, chemists will explore the best hits, improve them somewhat and hopefully find related structures that are promising enough to be considered leads and be included within a lead space. Successful continued optimization may locate a molecule that can be approved as a drug. Not all leads have drugs nearby, so not all leads can be sufficiently optimized to find a drug. An important idea is that the original hits from a screen are different in structure from subsequent leads. The lead series molecules will in turn be different from any final drugs.
Screening campaigns test collections of molecules to sample effectively molecular space for hits with promising activity. These hits represent chemical starting points for a drug discovery program.
