By the end of this video, you will be able to list the common animal species that are encountered in preclinical studies. You will also be able to explain how specific species are chosen for a particular drug program. The general toxicology studies perform toward the end of the drug discovery phase generate vital safety information for the IND application, or CTA. These safety studies are generally expected to include one rodent and one non-rodent species. Regulatory guidelines do not require any specific species, but only a few species are commonly encountered, mouse or rat for rodents and dog or non-human primate for non-rodents. Non-human primates are monkeys, typically macaques, while other species could possibly be used, the amount of historical data on these few species provides a strong baseline for determining safety risks. For small molecule drug projects, rats are the most common rodent species and dogs are the most common non-rodent species.
The species used in safety studies can vary based on how the molecule behaves in each species. Properties such as drug metabolism, pharmacokinetic properties, and tendencies for a species to show adverse effects will be considered. A species that shows a somewhat similar metabolic profile to humans may be favored in a toxicology study. One practical consideration is whether a particular animal species expresses a homolog of the human target at which the drug candidate is expected to be active. If not, that species would not be ideal for safety studies, as this would not test for on target toxicity. This same idea is important when investigating biological drugs such as monoclonal antibodies and protein therapeutics. Antibody toxicology studies are often limited to monkeys in which an antibody against a human target is most likely to have cross reactivity to a monkey target. If this crossreactivity does not exist, the drug hunting team may need to create another version of the antibody with the required crossreactivity in order to investigate on target toxicity. Similarly, studies of protein therapeutics can generate non informative immunologic responses in animal species. Using nonhuman primates, which are most similar to humans, can minimize the incidence of misleading immunologic responses.
The treatment and care of animals used in safety studies is highly regulated. In the United States, procedures are covered under the Animal Welfare Act. Regulations provide requirements for humane treatment, transport, and housing of the animals. In order to minimize the need for using animals in toxicology studies, pharmaceutical companies follow the 3R's replacement, reduction, and refinement. Replacement includes the use of in vitro technologies such as cell or tissue culture as early drug screens prior to the conduct of animal studies, the use of computational predictions or cell based organ on a chip methods in place of live animals. Reduction advocates for the use of fewer animals or maximizing the amount of information gained per animal studied. Refinement minimizes stress on the animals through methods such as digital technologies to observe animals in their home environments, and minimally invasive telemetry, along with animal husbandry practices such as socialization and enrichment procedures. Concerning this last point of animal welfare, research programs are highly motivated to provide the best possible living conditions for animals. Distressed animals tend to have poorer health outcomes that lead to spurious data having little or no relevance to the chemical entity being tested.
Preclinical toxicology studies performed before an IND application or CTA require results from both a rodent and non-rodent species. The results of these studies help determine safety expectations for a molecule once it enters the clinic.
