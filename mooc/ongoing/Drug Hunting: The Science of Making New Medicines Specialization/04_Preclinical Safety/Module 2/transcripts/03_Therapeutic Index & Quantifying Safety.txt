By the end of this video, you'll be able to describe how safety is measured during the drug discovery phase. You will also be able to define a molecule's therapeutic index. The US FDA and other regulatory agencies approve new molecules as drugs based on their being safe and effective. Not only is safety important from a regulatory standpoint, but safety can also differentiate one drug from another in clinical practice. All other things being equal, healthcare providers and patients will favor a drug with fewer adverse effects or lower toxicity when selecting between two drugs for the same medication. The final safety profile of a drug is based on the spectrum of adverse effects observed in humans, along with the potential for toxicities to arise at the approved dose, and at higher doses or exposures. Doses of a drug that are studied in humans are chosen to avoid toxicities that may arise at higher dose levels and dosing is based on part, on pre-clinical safety studies. Therefore, drug-hunting teams must be able to identify potential toxicities of an experimental compound, identify the dose or exposure at which they may occur, and identify safe doses to test in humans. The task of evaluating safety begins even as early as the lead selection stage. At this stage, the efficacy of a molecule is typically measured as activity against the target, either through binding or functional measures of potency; a KI or IC50 value. The potential toxicity of a molecule can be measured in terms of a potency at an unrelated or off-target modulation of which could lead to safety risks. For example, the popular antibiotic azithromycin, which is designed against a microbial target, also inhibits the human cardiac IKR channel, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. The full difference in potencies between the microbial target, the denominator, and human IKR; the numerator, is one way of quantifying the safety margin or therapeutic index for this compound, particularly at the stages when only in vitro data are available. Compounds with a high TI are considered safer than those with lower TI values. It is important to know what factors are being considered when calculating a safety margin or TI because not all toxicities are equal and measures of pharmacology or efficacy can vary. For example, is the safety margin based on adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract such as diarrhea or vomiting, or is it due to adverse effects on the heart, such as arrhythmia? As a drug-hunting program progresses, candidate molecules will eventually emerge for which efficacy and toxicity testing will involve studies in animals. It is possible to describe systemic exposure in animals purely based on plasma or blood concentration. Exposure may be related through C max; the peak concentration of the drug. Or the more common approach is to describe in vivo exposure through integration of the CP time curve for an area under curve AUC measure. The therapeutic index at this stage will be calculated using the ratio of two values which differ from the earlier in vitro example. In this case, the denominator is the minimal exposure predicted to achieve the desired therapeutic endpoint in humans. The other value, the numerator, is the highest exposure in animals that is deemed to be safe called the no observed adverse effect level or NOAEL. While a numeric TI value can give the impression of a clear metric for comparison of two molecules, TI value should be critically analyzed and clearly defined. One key factor is correct identification of a compound's adverse effects. Adverse effects can vary from one animal species to another. Toxicologists will need to consider whether an observed risk will likely be relevant if the compound enters clinical trials. Additionally, adverse effects must be weighed relative to the compound's indication. Drowsiness may be a problem for an allergy medication, but much less relevant for a life-saving drug. In summary, a molecule safety can be determined by quantifying its therapeutic index, which compares its efficacious concentration dose or exposure to those that lead to toxicity. Therapeutic index is one tool which informs the drug-hunting team of the relative risks versus benefits of a molecule and helps guide selection of a drug candidate to advance into the clinic
