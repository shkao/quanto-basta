By the conclusion of this video, you'll be able to both list and describe types of preclinical toxicology studies that are performed for drug candidates that have advanced to Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Here is a graphic that we have seen in an earlier video in this course. Note that the pre-clinical safety studies are not limited to the discovery period of new drug development. Pre-clinical safety toxicology studies continue even as a molecule has progressed into Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. These are conducted in parallel with clinical trials that monitor safety and efficacy in humans. Let's highlight a few selected examples of those later pre-clinical safety studies. As drug candidates progress through clinical trials, GLP toxicology studies of longer duration are typically required. The duration of these studies is based on the anticipated duration of dosing in human subjects. An additional consideration is the expected duration of the treatment once the drug is approved. The guidelines shown in this table differ somewhat from those for the GLP toxicology coverage of clinical trials, although following the ladder will often satisfy both requirements. Nonetheless, the drug hunting team must ensure both sets of guidelines are carefully considered. Another type of safety assessment performed while the drug is in the clinic, are the reproductive toxicology studies. There are three types of these studies. One fertility, two embryo fetal development, and three, pre and postnatal development. These reproductive toxicology studies, are typically conducting using rodents such as rats and mice. However, regulations require the embryo fetal development study also include a non rodent species, typically the rabbit. For the fertility studies, male and female non-pregnant rodents are administered to the drug prior to mating, during mating, and up to implantation. In the embryo fetal development studies, pregnant animals are administered to drug from implantation to closure of the hard palate. In other words, during the period of organogenesis, and the fetuses are evaluated at the end of gestation for external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. For the pre and postnatal development study, pregnant females are administered to drug from implantation through gestation and lactation. The offspring are monitored for viability, growth, and development, including learning and behavior continuing through sexual development and may include a mating phase. All three studies are critical as clinical trials progressing recruit a broader pool of patients. In particular, the embryo fetal development toxicity studies are important for informing women of child-bearing potential, of the potential risks of using the drug while pregnant. Finally, long-term carcinogenicity studies are often required for drug approval. These studies are typically performed in two species, the rat and mouse. These are lifetime studies and are approximately two years long. More recently, transgenic mice are commonly used and this study only takes about six months. Throughout the carcinogenicity study, the animals are dosed with a compound and observed for tumor development and progression. Carcinogenicity studies are not required for all molecules in clinical trials. If the indication does not require that the drug be taken for extended periods, for example, as with an antibiotic, then carcinogenicity testing will not be necessary. These studies are also not typically required for oncology indications, and less life expectancy is anticipated to be greater than or equal to five years. In this case, adjuvant therapies administered during this time generally require a carcinogenicity study be performed. For clinical indications where chronic drug administration will be required, additional toxicology studies evaluate long-term safety of the drug, as well as reproductive and carcinogenicity risks. These studies fall under the umbrella of pre-clinical safety testing, but they are actually performed after a molecule has advanced to later stage clinical trials
