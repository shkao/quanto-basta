By the end of this video, you will be able to list safety factors involved in determining appropriate doses for a molecule as it enters clinical trials. You will also be able to define some of the common terminology used with early dose selection. This slide shows a typical phase I.
Clinical study dose range for small molecule drugs, this dose range will begin at or below the maximum recommended starting dose or MRSD. The MRSD is a dose determined from preclinical toxicology and PK data and expected to be safe. The MRSD is a low enough dose or exposure that no adverse effects are expected in test subjects and no therapeutic effect is likely. Once the compound is confirmed to be safe at a low dose, gradual dose escalation will occur in additional subjects. These higher doses may exceed the predicted human efficacious dose, both to fully investigate the human PK and determine to what extent the dose can be increased until unacceptable tolerability or adverse events occur. For most indications other than cancer, the focus of these phase I trials is to investigate safety, tolerability, and PK, but not efficacy.
The MRSD, maximum recommended starting dose is a key value for starting clinical trials. An MRSD can be determined in several ways, the most common being through use of the No Observed Adverse Effect Level, NOAEL. The NOAEL is the highest dose of a molecule that does not cause adverse effects during preclinical toxicology or safety studies. It is also important to understand whether the MRSD is anticipated to elicit a clinically relevant or pharmacodynamic response in a human, particularly in general medicine where the phase I subjects are healthy volunteers. Regulatory agencies provide additional guidelines for further lowering the starting dose to minimize the risk of encountering unanticipated adverse events. The NOAEL is also used to determine the maximum dose in humans, particularly in general medicine trials. However, rather than using the NOAEL dose from the preclinical toxicology studies, the NOAEL exposure is used to calculate a human dose equivalent. This exposure cap, as it may be called, cannot be exceeded in a first in human trial without sound scientific and clinical justification. An example of such justification might be that any anticipated adverse events are minor, reversible, or easily monitored in the clinic. Calculation of an exposure cap alone does not justify dose escalation to that level in healthy volunteers, particularly if the exposure cap exceeds the anticipated human therapeutic dose range.
First-in-human trials for oncology indications or in some cases fatal disease where there is no therapeutic alternative, are designed differently from most other first-in-human trials. While phase I trials typically involve healthy volunteers, in oncology trials, phase I subjects are cancer patients. This is because molecules used against cancer targets often have significant safety risks beyond those seen in molecules for other indications. Therefore, the testing of potential cancer drugs in healthy subjects would not be ethical. Another difference for phase I oncology trials is the MRSD is not calculated based on the NOAEL and is expected to have some therapeutic effect. Because trial subjects have cancer, it is considered unethical to use a dose of the drug not expected to provide some benefit to the patient. Finally, oncology studies are typically not limited by a pre-determined exposure cap. Dose escalations continue until some number of patients in a dose group experience what are referred to as dose limiting toxicities. This approach is acceptable to identify a maximally efficacious dose that, while perhaps having significant safety risks, will be accepted by cancer patients in return for the clinical benefit. Preclinical safety studies are critical not only for understanding the potential safety risks of a drug, but also for determining both the starting and maximum doses for human clinical studies.
