By the end of this video you will be able to detail studies that support the transition of a molecule into clinical trials including genetic toxicity, general toxicology, safety pharmacology, and phototoxicity. Genetic toxicology testing determines the risk of a molecule being mutagenic, that is, causing DNA mutations or structural damage to chromosomes. Molecules that are mutagenic have a risk of causing cancer. A common test for mutagenicity is the Ames test. The Ames test is performed on bacteria and is therefore both simple to perform and provides rapid results. While the Ames test is not a perfect predictor for carcinogenicity, it is an adequate early predictor of mutagenicity risk. More extensive studies are conducted on the molecule if the compound advances into later clinical trials. General toxicology studies are another type of testing required before a molecule can be administered in humans. General toxicology studies are performed in animals and follow GLP guidelines. Animals included in these studies include one rodent species, usually the rat, and one non-rodent, typically dog or non-human primate, NHP, or monkeys. Studies include repeat dosing of a molecule and groups that receive a range of doses. Study designs typically include a vehicle control group and low, mid, and high dose level groups of the experimental drug. Researchers will search for any toxic effects from the molecule as well as whether the effects are reversible once dosing is stopped. If the molecule is known to target a specific organ, then the health and function of that organ will receive additional focus during clinical testing. An additional supporting pre-clinical test for antibody-based biologics includes tissue cross-reactivity using the candidate antibody. The potential for a protein biologics such as an antibody drug to elicit an immunological response leading to the formation of anti-drug antibodies will also be evaluated. Another important consideration for general toxicology studies is that for every anticipated day of dosing in a human subject there must be a day of dosing in an animal GLP toxicology study. For instance, if a clinical trial will dose human subjects for 13 weeks there must be a GLP toxicology study of equivalent or longer duration. This relationship holds until greater than six months of human dosing, which will be covered by a six-month study in rodents and a nine-month study in non-rodents. Oncology studies have slightly different requirements in that a four-week GLP toxicology study independent of the duration of human dosing will cover Phase I and II clinical trials. Before entering Phase III, a 13-week GLP toxicology study is required. Safety pharmacology, while it also supports early clinical studies, is distinct from general toxicology. Safety pharmacology focuses on acute life-threatening risks of a molecule on key organ systems. Organs and systems of interest include the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, and respiratory system. The purpose of safety pharmacology is to identify uncommon and potentially clinically relevant adverse events, AEs, that would unlikely be identified by general toxicology methods. A secondary objective is to identify a detection method for the adverse event. The CNS and respiratory studies are typically performed in rats. Cardiovascular studies are performed in dogs or non-human primates. Note that cardiovascular studies include monitoring cardiac QT prolongation and in vivo assessment of the hERG or I_Kr activity for which in vitro assays for inhibition of this channel were performed in earlier discovery stages. Depending upon the chemical structure of a low molecular weight compound, there is the potential that the compound may absorb light in the UV visible spectrum and under certain circumstances such as distribution to skin or binding to melanin may produce phototoxicity. A drug with phototoxic potential may increase the incidence and/or severity of skin reactions to sunlight exposure. Compounds which have light-absorbing properties can be tested for phototoxic potential using an in vitro cell-based assay that tests for increased cytotoxicity in the presence of a radiation. An example of a commonly encountered drug that shows phototoxicity is the antibiotic, tetracycline, shown in the upper-right corner of the slide. In vivo pre-clinical studies on genetic toxicity, general toxicology, safety pharmacology, and phototoxicity collectively provide key information on the safety risk of a molecule so that early studies in humans can be initiated with minimal risk to trial participants
