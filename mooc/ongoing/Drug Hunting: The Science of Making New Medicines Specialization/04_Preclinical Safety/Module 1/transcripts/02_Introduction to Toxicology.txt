By the end of this video, you will be able to define the idea of toxicology. You'll be able to differentiate between toxicology and pharmacology. Finally, you will be able to describe the role of toxicology in a drug hunting program. Paracelsus was a historical figure, and generally considered to be the father of toxicology. During Paracelsus' lifetime from 1493 to 1541, Paracelsus studied medicine, theology, and philosophy. A famous quote attributed to Paracelsus is in Latin, sola dosis facit venenum, in English, the quote means only the dose makes the poison. In its full context, Paracelsus quote points out that drugs, when used at too high of a dose can carry toxic risks that outweigh the drug's potential benefits. The idea that a drug may not be completely free of safety risks may seem counter-intuitive. Yet all drugs carry some degree of risk, even at therapeutic doses, no matter how small. The US Food and Drug Administration approves new drugs based on their benefits outweighing the known and potential risks for the intended population. The intended population is an important consideration, and indicates safety risks are evaluated in the context of the disease being treated. Referring back to Paracelsus, exceeding the approved therapeutic doses for a drug can lead to significant adverse events as can using a drug for an unapproved indication. Toxicology guides the understanding of the safety risks of a drug. But what is toxicology? Toxicology is the study of poisons. In the context of drug discovery, toxicology focuses on the potential toxic, poisonous effects of molecules that are being considered as potential drugs. In contrast, the field of pharmacology emphasizes the therapeutic benefits, not the toxicity of potential drugs. Both Toxicology and Pharmacology are essential fields for drug development. Pharmacology is needed to understand the molecule's therapeutic benefit, toxicology is needed to understand safety risks. While pharmacology focuses on the action of molecules on the intended target protein, toxicological studies must be open to toxicity from the intended target, its associated pathways, and off target effects. Within a drug program, scientists who study a molecule's toxicology are part of the pre-clinical safety group. The term pre-clinical can be misleading as the efforts of a pre-clinical safety team continue even while a molecule is being studied in humans, in clinical trials. Because some pre-clinical safety studies are concurrent with clinical trials, some in drug discovery prefer the term non-clinical safety over pre-clinical safety. Understanding of molecule's toxicology is just as important as its pharmacology for regulatory approval. All drugs have safety risks, and toxicologists not only identify the risks, but also determine the dosages, concentrations, and exposures that can lead to toxicity.
