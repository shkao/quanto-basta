By the end of this video, you will be able to describe safety risks observed in three approved drugs. You will also be able to outline the evolution of the regulatory approval process with respect to preclinical safety.
Sulfanilamide is an antibacterial drug that is typically administered in pill form, pills can be a challenge for small children. In 1937, a pharmaceutical company created a new formulation for sulfanilamide, the new formulation was a syrup. One of the solvents in the syrup was diethylene glycol, or DEG, DEG imparted a sweet flavor to the syrup to make it more palatable for children. The new formulation was marketed as elixir sulfanilamide, the drug was distributed in September 1937 and by October, patient deaths were reported. In total, over 100 deaths were linked to DEG in elixir sulfanilamide, even at low doses, DEG can cause kidney failure and death. At the time, preclinical safety testing of new drugs and formulations was not required. Furthermore, the risks of DEG were generally not known. Because of the elixir sulfanilamide experience, the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed in the United States. The legislation gave the US Food and Drug Administration authority to monitor the safety of drugs and determine safety standards.
Moving on to our next example. In 1957, the drug thalidomide was marketed for anxiety and insomnia, the drug also reduced nausea and was recommended for use in pregnant patients experiencing morning sickness. In the following years, over 10,000 children were born with deformities associated with the use of thalidomide by the pregnant mother. Thalidomide was subsequently removed from markets, follow-up safety testing showed that thalidomide impairs organ and tissue development in the fetus. The most commonly observed deformity involves underdeveloped arms and or legs, a condition called phocomelia. The thalidomide tragedy affected children in many countries around the world, the United States was relatively unaffected. Largely because Francis Oldham Kelsey, a reviewer for the US FDA, denied approval to thalidomide because of unsatisfactory testing of the molecule. Learning from the thalidomide experience, most drug regulatory agencies around the world increased requirements for preclinical safety testing of new drug candidates. Interestingly, while thalidomide has this very unfortunate history, it was later found to be useful for treating certain types of cancer, as well as complications of leprosy. Our final example is terfenadine, terfenadine is an antihistamine for the treatment of allergy symptoms. Within a few years of approval in the mid 1980s, isolated patients taking terfenadine suffered arrhythmias, which were often fatal. By 1990, the risks had been connected to patients taking both terfenadine and either certain antibiotics or antifungal agents. What was happening? To understand the toxicity of terfenadine, we need to look at terfenadine more closely.
Terfenadine, shown on the left, is a prodrug, terfenadine is not active, but is metabolized by liver cytochrome P453A4 to a metabolite called fexofenadine. Fexofenadine is the active form of the drug against the histamine H1 receptor. In most patients, conversion of terfenadine to fexofenadine is fast. In rare cases, such as if a patient is taking certain antibiotics or antifungal agents that block the CYP3A4 enzyme, concentration of terfenadine will rise. Unknown at the time of terfenadine's approval, terfenadine is a hERG channel blocker. HERG stands for human ether-a-go-go receptor gene and encodes the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac IKr potassium channel. Blocking the activity of this cardiac ion channel can lead to life threatening arrhythmias. Based on the toxicity of terfenadine, preclinical safety testing of molecules for hERG activity has become standard practice. These three historical cases of safety issues in approved drugs have yielded valuable insights and continue to affect preclinical safety testing in today's new drugs.
