It is my pleasure to be here with Stephanie Dodd. Stephanie Dodd is a formulation scientist at Novartis. Stephanie, would you please introduce yourself and tell us what your current position is at Novartis? Hi, Erland. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me today, I'm glad to share my background and experience with you. As you mentioned, my name is Stephanie Dodd, I'm based at Novartis in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I'm a biopharmaceutics expert for technical research and development. Great. What is your educational background? I'm actually a chemist. I have a Bachelor's and Master's in Chemistry, and I started off my career in illocal chemistry and have sales transitioned into preformulation and biopharmaceutics in the recent years. Great. How did you get to your current position? What was that process? I mean it was really an evolution. As I mentioned, I was an illocal chemist. When I started and I did a lot of characterization work for the formulation scientists and I became really interested in understanding how they develop their formulations and what went into this. I started learning about solid state chemistry formulation aspects, how to pick excipients and the role of the excipients in the solid state on the bio performance, and this is how I really got into the area of biopharmaceutics, which really marries the solid state, the physicochemical properties, and the formulation of the molecule into delivery of the drug successfully in preclinical species where I work, or in the clinic as well. Fantastic. What are some of the typical activities that might define your average day, if there is one, or average week? I spend a lot of time doing modeling and simulation nowadays, so we have softwares, both internally and commercially available, that we use to do absorption based modeling, not only in prespecies to help us with our design of our pharmacology and toxicology studies, but also in clinical area as well. Before the dosing is performed. This is all somewhat extensively modeled to try to ensure success of the experiment. The modeling is a great tool because it really allows you to take in all the key physical chemical properties. Any formulation in vitro work that you've done and any PK that you may already have to be able to pick out doses where you think that your formulation deliver a differentiation both in the preclinical space and in the clinical space is where we're very concerned as well. Great. How does your position support other scientists at Novartis?
What the modeling does is really helped to put everything in perspective. It helps us to translate across species, across Parandal states, fed and fasting animals across roots of administration. It helps us to really understand the molecule and vitro studies that need to happen and also the vivo studies that complement all of this work. But we really rely on the modeling to help us zone in on where we need to look and where we need to optimize. When I think of the landscape of drug discovery and drug development, when does preformulation really kick in? Is this early lead optimization? Where did you begin to enter the story? With Novartis, our group was created almost two decades ago now, and it's really to sit at that interface between research and development. We're involved in the process really early during lead optimization, giving feedback to the chemists supporting the formulations that are going into the animal studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the compound in animal, and then the further translation of that into the human studies as well. Our team is involved really in the design of the molecules and then as well as selecting what formulation strategy we're going to be taking into the clinic. That's the last involvement we have with the molecules. As an organic chemist, I hate to say it, I'm always just watching potency, I mean, that's like doctors, that is just such a small piece of really what it takes to discover drugs. Even I had an oncology meeting yesterday. I'm covering an oncology project for one of my colleagues who's out on paternity leave for the next couple of months. They were having the discussion, they have potency but just not really good oral absorption properties, and what should they do? Should we just flip over to parental round administration and just focus on the potency and try to get it as potent as possible and do some subcutaneous delivery, or do they still the patient? It keeps coming up the patient, what would the patient want? This is always in the back of our minds like what it's going to be the best for that particular patient population with that particular cancer. Talking to the assay scientists, they were. You can develop a tool compound or you can develop a drug. Yeah, exactly. A lot of tool compounds, we need more drug. They're usually very far from each other. Yes. Very far apart and it takes years. But I think if you make sure your tool compound has,a specific property range that it's in, then it shouldn't take you that long to get to a drug [inaudible]. When you were thinking about engaging in drug discovery, what was it that attracted you to work at a larger pharmaceutical company? That's a great question. I actually started my career at a very large pharmaceutical company. It was Genic Institute back in the day and they had just been purchased by Wyeth. I really got the experience of going from a mid size to a very large pharmaceutical conglomerate at that point. I did, being in the Boston area, I really did have the opportunity to go back actually and work in a small biotech which is phenomenal. A lot of exposure to pre formulation work all the way up to filing, and even post marketing commitments. It was a phenomenal experience. But usually with a small companies, it's just one or two molecules you get to work on. I really wanted to go back to that experience where I had a lot of molecules and different disease areas, different patient populations to work in. Definitely, I've experienced that at Novartis over almost the past 15 years. Can you share approximately how many projects are you involved with at any given time? Yeah, we have quite a rich portfolio at Novartis. Honestly, it ranges from maybe 20-25 projects that I'm involved in per year. Our portfolio of early projects is almost 100. It's quite a large and diverse portfolio. Okay, great. You definitely get to see a lot of variety. I do, I feel like a little bit, sometimes an encyclopedia for Novartis because I remember all the molecules as they go through and what the key attributes of them were. Even seeing them coming into the clinic and then, hopefully getting to registration is really satisfying. That's great. Can you share anything about some of your current projects and how they may be affecting Novartis and patients? Yeah, so one thing I've been involved in the last couple of years is the International Quality Consortium. It basically is a mixture of pharmaceutical companies and academics who work to answer specific questions around drug discovery and drug development. Really giving best practices to the industry and to the regulatory and academia in this space. One of the things I've been working on is prediction of food effects. I've been working across companies. We just had an industry paper come out last year on prediction of food effects. It really impacts patients whether they have to take their medicine with food. Without food, it all becomes very important and you want the medicines to be very safe for them as well. We put a lot of effort into not only entertaining food effects, but other Co medications that patients will take with their medicine that may impact their body. How body metabolizes things or maybe even their stomach ph is affected if they're taking an anti acid. Sometimes you have to worry about if our compound will perform well and absorb into the body really well. This is a key focus for us is patient centricity artist now. Great. Really some broad collaborative projects across companies throughout the industry. Absolutely. What are some of the things that you see as future challenges in formulation science that you would hope to see solved during your career? Yeah, I mean challenges for us definitely the chemical space is getting very tricky. I think Novartis, we've been blessed because we've had this pre clinical pre formulation group really integrated with research for such a long period of time. We've been blessed to have really, not easy to deal with but very standard physical chemical property space to deal with. But we do see after going after more novel targets and previously sort of undrugable targets, the Pre formulation state is getting very challenging. I see us having to adapt and coming up with new formulation technologies in the future to try to meet the demand of where drug discovery is taking us. Then also, integration of artificial intelligence, I think is going to be key tool for the formulation scientists in the future to really direct the experimentation that they need to conduct to settle on a final formulation. Fantastic. I look forward to hearing about stories about AI and drug discovery and formulation. Sure. Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to share with the participants in the class about your experiences in pre formulation. Yeah, my pleasure. Thank you very much, Roland. Okay, take care. Take care.
