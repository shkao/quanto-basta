By the end of this video, you'll be able to define the idea of formulation. You will be able to differentiate a drug substance from a drug product. Finally, you will be able to describe how pre-formulation serves drug discovery. A formulation is a mixture that contains a therapeutic compound that can be safely and reproducibly administered to animals or humans. The therapeutic compound often called the drug substance or API, which stands for active pharmaceutical ingredient, has a defined physical form, whether it is a crystalline or salt form. The drug substance is contained within various excipients in a formulation. Examples of excipients include binders in tablets, or buffered solutions for an injectable drug. The drug substance and its excipients in a formulation intended to be administered to a human are collectively called the drug product. The drug product must be able to be manufactured, stored, transported, and delivered to patients in a reproducible manner that maintains the efficacy and safety of the drug. On the screen are just a few examples of formulations. On the left are a number of pills for oral drugs. In the middle is an inhaler designed to allow drug administration to the airways. On the right is a glass vial from which one or more doses of an injectable drug may be withdrawn. Formulations can be encountered in many other embodiments, including lotions, drops, sprays, et cetera. Pre-formulation does not establish the final drug product that will be used if the compound is approved. Instead, pre-formulation meets the needs of transitioning a lead compound from one that is studied through in vitro methods to a compound that is studied in vivo, which includes both pre-clinical studies as well as Phase 1 clinical trials. The ease of preparing and manufacturing advanced leads into a suitable formulation will be considered during lead selection. The goal of pre-formulation in the clinical space is to provide stable, scalable, and reproducible formulations that maximize absorption of the drug into the body. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology all require formulations to deliver the drug substance into animals such that safety and efficacy can be evaluated and established. The goal of pre-formulation in the clinical space is to ensure consistent drug absorption and exposure into the human body with as little variability as possible to confirm safety and efficacy in humans. We have now defined what formulation means, and we can distinguish between a drug substance or API and a drug product. Finally, we described how pre-formulation supports lead selection, pre-clinical studies, and Phase 1 trials
