By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to define the idea of physicochemical properties. You will also be able to list and describe several properties that are particularly relevant to drug formulation. Physicochemical properties are any physical or chemical property of a drug substance. There are hundreds of physicochemical properties. They include properties like melting point and density. In the context of pre-formulation, solubility, lipophilicity, and ionization are the properties we will emphasize in this discussion. Solubility is a key physicochemical property. Solubility is the mass of a drug that can be dissolved into a volume of a liquid. For pre-formulation, solubility affects many aspects of a drug and is measured in multiple different media. In biological fluids, such as tears or intestinal fluid, higher solubility may improve absorption. Solubility in different organic solvents is critical for selection of an optimal solvent system for crystallization. Crystallization is relevant for both purification and providing a specific particle form of a drug which can affect in vivo solubility. Finally, drugs that are administered as solutions will be tested for solubility in different liquid excipients to determine which allow delivery of an adequate drug dose. While solubility is a physical-chemical property, solubility is influenced by other properties including lipophilicity and ionization. Lipophilicity is simply a definition of the fat-loving nature of a molecule. Lipophilic drugs have a high affinity for fats and dissolve well in fats or oils. Lipophilicity is measured by logP, which determines if the drug likes to partition into the oil phase, octanol or the water phase, the aqueous phase. Higher logP values indicate a drug is more lipophilic. Highly lipophilic compounds generally have poor aqueous solubility, which is a risk for poor or variable absorption of the drug by the body. Absorption of lipophilic drugs may increase if a patient consumes food with the drug because of fats in the food, this is often called a food effect. A food effect can impact a drug's efficacy and safety and can be mitigated in certain cases through changes to formulation. Ionization describes the degree to which a drug is charged or neutral. Changes to ionization normally occur through protonation or deprotonation of a drug. Ionization is represented by a drug's pKa which is the pH, where 50% of the drug is ionized and is a measure of a drug's acidity. The pH of body fluids can range from about 1-8 and the pH of the fluids affects the charge of an acidic or basic drug. In general, basic drugs are protonated and charged, ionized in a medium with a low pH and neutral at higher pH. Ionized molecules tend to have higher solubility than neutral molecules. Therefore, weakly basic drugs are more soluble and low pH body fluids, like stomach acid. Acidic drugs follow the opposite trend
and therefore normally show higher solubility in higher pH body fluids, like blood or intestinal fluid. A drug's ionization must be compatible with its intended route of delivery. Formulation can impact ionization and therefore can be employed successfully to improve solubility and absorption of the drug. We have now learned what physicochemical properties are and then focused on solubility, lipophilicity, and ionization as three key properties that can affect a drug's absorption
