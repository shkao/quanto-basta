## Drug Product Stability

### Learning Objectives

- **Objective 1**: List stability factors affecting a drug product in production, storage, and transport.
- **Objective 2**: Contrast stability concerns for small molecule drugs relative to biological drugs.

### Stability of the Drug Product

- **Production**: Factors during the production process that can affect the stability of drug products.
- **Packaging & Storage**: The way drugs are packaged and stored can impact their long-term stability.
- **Transport**: Stability concerns related to the transportation of drug products, including temperature changes and handling conditions.

### Production, Packaging, & Storage

- **Excipient Interactions**:
  - **Hydrolysis**: Breakdown of compounds due to reaction with water.
  - **Oxidation**: Chemical degradation due to exposure to oxygen.
  - **Polymerization**: Chemical reactions that lead to the formation of polymers, potentially altering drug stability.

- **Manufacturing Process & Packaging**:
  - **Mixing (wet or dry)**: The method of mixing drug substances, either with moisture (wet) or without (dry), can affect stability.
  - **Mechanical agitation**: Physical movement or shaking during production that may impact drug integrity.
  - **Compression**: The process of compressing materials for compaction or tableting, affecting the final product's form and stability.

- **Storage**:
  - **Light**: Exposure to light can degrade certain drug compounds.
  - **Heat**: High temperatures can destabilize drug products.
  - **Humidity**: Moisture in the air can lead to degradation, especially through hydrolysis.

### Stability During Transit

- **Chemical Drugs**:
  - Generally more stable than biological drugs.
  - Includes forms such as tablets, creams, drops, ointments, and injectables.

- **Biological Drugs**:
  - Have a limited shelf-life.
  - Includes peptides, antibodies, and oligonucleotides.
  - Requires transport via a "cold-chain" with specific temperature conditions:
    - **Ambient**: 15 to 30°C
    - **Refrigerated**: 2 to 8°C
    - **Freezer**: -25 to -10°C
    - **Ultra-low freezer**: -70 to -90°C
    - **Vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (N₂)**: -135 to -196°C
    - **Liquid-phase liquid nitrogen (N₂)**: -195°C

## Impurities

### Learning Objectives

- **Objective 1**: Define the concept of drug impurities.
- **Objective 2**: List the types, origin, and risks associated with impurities.
- **Objective 3**: Describe selected limits of allowed impurities.

### Defining Drug Impurities

- Any component of a drug substance that is not the chemical entity defined as the drug substance.
- Any component of a drug product that is not a formulation ingredient or the drug substance.
- Impurities may originate from the manufacturing process or from degradation during storage.
- Impurities can be organic or inorganic, volatile or non-volatile, and may be identified or unidentified.

### Accounting for Impurities

- **Reported** if impurity level is ≥ 0.05%.
- **Identified** if impurity level is ≥ 0.10%, requiring structural determination.
- **Qualified** if impurity level is ≥ 0.15%, necessitating safety testing of the impurity.

### Impurities and Efficacy

- **Specification**: Drug formulation activity must meet specified standards.
- **Assay specification**: Typically requires the drug to maintain 90%-110% of its intended activity.
- If a drug falls outside of this specification range, it may no longer be used, leading to:
  - **Recall**
  - **Expiration**

### Impurities and Quality

- **Regulatory agencies** (e.g., FDA, EMA, WHO) provide guidance on establishing drug quality.
- **ICH (International Conference on Harmonization)** offers guidance on the identification, characterization, and qualification of impurities.

## Clinical Formulation Development

### Learning Objectives

- **Objective 1**: List goals for Phase I formulation development.
- **Objective 2**: List additional considerations that affect Phase I formulation.

### Key Aspects of Phase I Clinical Trials

- **Drug safety, tolerability, & PK**: Focus on assessing the drug's safety, how well it is tolerated, and its pharmacokinetics (PK).
- **Typically in healthy volunteers**: Phase I trials often involve healthy participants.
- **Evaluate drug at a range of doses**: Different doses are tested to understand the drug's effects.
- **Possibly efficacy information**: Particularly in oncology trials, there may be preliminary efficacy data collected.

### Goals of Clinical Formulation Development (with GRAS consideration)

- **Understand disease and patient population**: Assess if healthy volunteers or patients will be involved in Phase I, and consider the trial setting.
- **Identify ideal route of administration**: Account for special needs of patients when selecting the route.
- **Determine amount of drug required**: Decide on on-site or remote formulation, manage transit and storage, and ensure excipient safety (such as those categorized as **GRAS** — Generally Recognized as Safe).
- **Design a formulation with consistent drug exposure**: Ensure that the formulation provides consistent drug delivery.

### Considerations of Clinical Formulation Development (Phase I)

- **Drug-food interactions**: Consider how the drug interacts with food intake.
- **Palatability/tolerability**: Ensure the formulation is palatable and tolerable for the patient.
- **Drug loading**: Determine the appropriate amount of drug per dosage.
- **Dosing frequency**: Set the schedule for how often the drug needs to be administered.
- **Manufacturing**: Take into account the feasibility and complexity of the manufacturing process.
- **Stability**: Ensure that the drug remains stable over time.
- **Cost**: Consider the economic aspects of producing and delivering the formulation.

## Biologics

### Learning Objectives

- **Differentiate** pre-formulation of small molecule drugs from biologics.
- **List key considerations** for the pre-formulation of biologics.

### Small Molecule Drugs vs. Biologics

- **Small Molecule Drugs**:
  - Focus on polymorphism and physical form.

- **Biologics**:
  - Stability considerations.
  - Excipient compatibility.
  - Drug loading.
  - Sterilization requirements.

### Sterility: A Key Challenge for Biologics Pre-formulation

- **Manufacture of the biologic**: Ensuring sterility during production.
- **Formulation of the biologic**: Maintaining sterility throughout the formulation process.
- **Packaging of the biologic**: Using sterile packaging to protect the product.
- **Shipping & storage**: Ensuring sterile conditions are maintained during transport and storage.
- **"In-use" for the patient**: Ensuring sterility when the product is used by the patient.

### Common Effects of Excipients

- **Enhance stability**: Help maintain the stability of the drug.
- **Improve solubility**: Increase the drug's solubility in a solution.
- **Reduce aggregation**: Prevent drug molecules from clumping together.
- **Control formulation pH**: Maintain the pH level to ensure the drug's effectiveness.
- **Act as preservatives**: Protect the formulation from degradation.
- **Prevent microbial growth**: Inhibit the growth of harmful microorganisms in the drug formulation.
