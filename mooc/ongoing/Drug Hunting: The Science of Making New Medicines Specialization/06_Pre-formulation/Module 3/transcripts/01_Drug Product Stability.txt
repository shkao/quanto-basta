By the end of this video, you will be able to list the stability factors that affect production, storage, and transport of the drug product. You will also be able to contrast stability concerns for small molecule drugs against biologics. Just as understanding the stability of the drug substance, is important for maintaining the safety, and efficacy of a drug, the stability of a drug product is also essential. The drug product is prepared through a manufacturing process. The drug product must be stable during packaging, and during storage. Finally, the drug product must remain stable as it travels through the distribution network, and reaches the patient. Formulation stability is much more complex than that of the solid drug substance, as a formulation consists of the drug substance, and often many excipients. Excipients include tablet binders, pH buffers, salts, solvents, and emulsifiers, among other ingredients. Each of these excipients must be carefully chosen to avoid detrimental interactions with the drug substance. The excipients themselves must also be of high purity, and stability so that they do not degrade in the formulation. The process for manufacturing the formulation can also cause degradation. For example, a wet granulation process, which involves water, could cause hydrolysis of a sensitive drug substance. Capsule shells used to contain the drug may be chosen based on low water content or low hygroscopicity as well. Tablets can be film-coated to prevent water intrusion. Mechanical processes such as mixing, agitating, sieving, and compression involve physical forces that can alter the properties of the drug product. Storage of the drug product at its site of manufacturer or by the patient can also introduce stability problems due to light, heat, and humidity. For example, a medicine cabinet in a hot, humid bathroom, maybe a poor location for storing medications. Closely related to storage of a drug, is the transport of a drug product from one location to another. The stability concerns often depend on the type of drug being transported. Small molecule drugs are chemical drugs. These include most tablets, drops, lotions, and many injectables. Chemical drugs have fewer stability concerns in transit. Biological drugs, which include protein, antibody, and oligonucleotide-based treatments, are far less stable, and often require careful temperature control, transit storage conditions, or the cold chain entered public awareness during the COVID-19 pandemic. One COVID vaccine required refrigeration during transit and storage. Another required freezer conditions, and still another required freezer, transit, and ultra-low freezer storage. Maintaining the efficacy, and safety of the vaccines required, maintaining the cold chain. Additionally, finding ultra-low freezer storage in hospitals, and pharmacies posed a logistical challenge. In this video, we listed the most common factors that affect the stability of a drug product. We specifically focused on possible degradation during transportation, which is normally much more important for biologics than small molecule drugs.
