By the end of this video, you will be able to list common routes of administration for drugs. You will also be able to describe how scientists working in pre-formulation help to determine the optimal route of administration for a specific compound.
The route of administration is the manner by which a drug is administered to a patient. There are many possible routes of administration, and four main factors tend to dictate the optimal route of administration of a drug. The first factor is the physicochemical properties of the drug. Second, the route of administration must allow the drug to reach its intended site of action. Third, the selected route of administration must provide a reasonable rate and extent of absorption for the drug. Finally, the route must be patient centric. In other words, patients must be willing to accept and adhere to the route of administration.
On the screen are some common routes of administration. The easiest routes allow a patient to self medicate without assistance from healthcare staff. These routes include oral, inhalation, local delivery, nasal, ocular, and audic or to the ear. Some of these routes are more convenient than others, but they all can reduce cost to the patient by avoiding visits to their healthcare provider. For example, almost all biologic therapies such as vaccines, proteins, and antibodies require parenteral administration to reach the intended target in the body. Many other factors can affect the route of administration. For example, patients may be very ill or even unconscious and unable to administer their own medication. In some cases, the medication must be administered inside the body such as with a surgically implanted device. Drug delivery is a very dynamic field and new technologies are continually being developed to meet the growing needs of patients.
Let us connect pre-formulation to selection of a drug's route of administration. The physicochemical properties of a lead are optimized to achieve a desired route of delivery. Patients who receive the drug are a key focus during this stage of drug discovery. If for instance, the drug will treat a broad patient pool, the drug will need to be compatible with self-administration of the drug by the patient. In this case, an oral therapy would likely be the most desirable route of administration. The chemists and pre-formulation scientists will design the drug to be not only safe and efficacious, but also amenable to oral administration. The drug will therefore need to have reasonable solubility in the gastrointestinal tract to facilitate absorption. The drug will need to show membrane permeability to diffuse across the intestinal wall and enter systemic circulation. It will need to be stable not only to GI fluids, but also to manufacturing, shipment, and storage as a drug product. Finally, the dose of the drug needs to be reasonably acceptable to the patient. For instance, if the drug has poor solubility, poor absorption or low potency, a larger dose may be necessary to reach a therapeutic effect in a patient. This limitation may result in the patient having to take many or larger pills which may not be acceptable. Therefore, from the outset of the program, pre-formulation scientists will monitor the overall properties of any leads so that the desired route of administration can be achieved.
We have now reviewed some of the most common routes of administration. We also now recognize how pre-formulation monitors key physicochemical properties of a drug so that a drug is better positioned to have the desired route of administration.
