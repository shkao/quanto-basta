By the end of this video, you will be able to describe some of the common routes of drug administration. You will also be able to connect which pharmacokinetic parameters are most relevant for different routes of administration. Many drugs are administered systemically, meaning the entire body is exposed to the drug. Generally, after the drug reaches a circulatory system. Systemic administration is often divided into two categories. One is enteral administration, which is administration via the GI tract. While this route of administration is commonly associated with oral dosing, it may also be sublingual, buccal, or rectal. The other is parenteral administration, which does not involve GI absorption. Parenterally administered drugs avoid the hepatic first pass effect, but may have other barriers to absorption. Parenteral administration examples include various routes of injection, such as intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular. Surgical implants and transdermal patches are also examples of parenteral routes of administration. Of the parenteral routes, only IV administers the drug directly into the general circulation. In contrast, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections create a depot of drug at the site of injection, whether under the skin or in the muscle. The drug, while in the body, has not reached the circulation and must still undergo absorption. Subcutaneous and intramuscular injections do not suffer from the first pass effect that may follow oral administration where the drug is metabolized in the gut wall or liver before it can reach other parts of the body. Nevertheless, absorption following subcutaneous or intramuscular injections can be reduced because of drug degradation before reaching the circulation. Local administration involves delivering the drug directly to its site of action. Local is in contrast with systemic administration, in which the drug typically has access to the entire body through the circulatory system. Local administration formulations include many lotions, nasal sprays, eye drops, and inhalers such as for asthma drugs. While an advantage of local administration is restricting the drug site of action to a specific tissue or organ, even these drugs may reach the systemic circulation to some extent. If that were to happen, unwanted adverse events may occur. Considerable effort is often invested in minimizing this risk as topical drug candidates are optimized. On the screen are listed four key pharmacokinetic parameters, clearance, volume of distribution, half-life, and bioavailability. We will more fully describe each of these parameters in subsequent videos. The importance of these parameters depends on the route of administration. The first two parameters, clearance and volume of distribution, are primary PK parameters, whereas half-life is a secondary parameter as it is driven by the drugs clearance and volume of distribution. These three parameters are typically used in reference to the systemic circulation, most often the plasma compartment of blood, and hence pertain to the enteral and parenteral routes of administration. These parameters are less relevant to local administration, since in most cases, locally administered drugs are intended to remain at or near their site of administration. Bioavailability is related to the extent to which a drug reaches the systemic circulation and is an important parameter for all non IV injection routes. IV administered drugs are 100% bioavailable. Also note that aside from bioavailability, once a drug has reached the plasma, it's primary PK parameters will be the same regardless of its route of administration. We have now listed and distinguished different routes of administration. We have also described which PK parameters are informative depending on the drugs route of administration.
