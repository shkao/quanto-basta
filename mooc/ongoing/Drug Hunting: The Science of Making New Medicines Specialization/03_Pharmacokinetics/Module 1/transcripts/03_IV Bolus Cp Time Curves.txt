By the end of this video, you will be able to summarize the concepts of ADME or absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. You will be able to sketch a typical Cp-time curve from a drug administered as an IV bolus. You will also be able to calculate selected PK parameters from the Cp-time data points.
Let's quickly define ADME, which describes key components of pharmacokinetics. A is for absorption, which is the movement of drug from its site of administration to the systemic circulation. D is for distribution, the movement of drug to and from circulation and various tissues and organs in the body. M is for metabolism, which is the chemical modification of a drug. Metabolism is most often associated with the liver, hepatic metabolism. E is for excretion, the removal of intact drug, mostly associated with the kidneys, renal filtration, and liver, biliary secretion. Let's now apply these ideas to representative PK data.
Here are representative Cp-time data points for a drug administered as an IV bolus. Cp stands for plasma concentration. Drug concentrations are usually measured in the plasma or serum. Whole blood is drawn from a patient, centrifuged, and the supernatant plasma is analyzed for the drug. Typical units are mass over volume, such as nanograms per milliliter. Let's sketch a curve through these points and relate the curve to ADME. Absorption, A, is instantaneous for an IV bolus since the drug is administered into the systemic circulation. Distribution, D, cannot be obviously visualized on the curve, though we will return to distribution on the next slide. Metabolism and excretion are relevant to this curve. Cp drops over time. This change in Cp over time is elimination.
Elimination occurs as a drug is removed from the plasma, a process that is specifically called clearance. As drug in the blood flows through the liver, some drug is cleared through hepatic metabolism. As drug flows through the kidneys, some drug may be cleared through filtration, renal excretion. Note that the curve defines an area, an area under the curve or AUC. AUC is a common way to describe drug exposure. The units of AUC are Cp times time, in this case nanogram hours per milliliter. If the drug dose, D, is known and the area under the curve can be calculated, then clearance can also be calculated. Clearance is literally the volume of plasma from which drug is removed per unit time. Because dose may have units of amount of drug per kilogram of body weight, very often clearance is also expressed on a per kilogram basis. Clearance is one of the key pharmacokinetic parameters of a drug.
When the y-axis is changed to log Cp, the Cp-time data points for most drugs fall on a line.
The slope of the line is related to kel, the elimination rate constant with units of inverse time. From kel, one can directly calculate the half life of a drug. The units are, time from kel or half life as well as clearance, one can calculate Vd which is the apparent volume of distribution, sometimes just called volume of distribution. Vd has units of volume, or sometimes volume per kilogram of patient mass. Vd provides a quantitative estimate of the extent of distribution of a drug. Vd is a key PK parameter. A higher Vd indicates a drug favors distributing into the body's tissues rather than remaining only in the plasma. Note that the Vd of a drug must be at least high enough to allow distribution of the drug to its intended target.
We have now reviewed ADME and connected the concepts of ADME to Cp-time data for an IV bolus. We have also used Cp-time data to calculate key PK parameters.
