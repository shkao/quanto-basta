It is my pleasure to join Sujal Deshmuk, who's a member of the staff at Novartis, and that he's going to share with us some of his insights in his work at Novartis. So, Sujal, would you please introduce yourself, and we'll roll right into the questions. >> Speaker 2: Hi, my name is Sujal Deshmukh. I am part of the NIBR division within Novartis, I work for the PKS group, and within that I am leading the in vitro ADME efforts for the PK science department. >> Speaker 1: Fantastic, and PKS stands for? >> Pharmacokinetic sciences. >> Speaker 1: Pharmacokinetic sciences, thank you very much. So, how did you get to your current position at NIBR?
>> Speaker 2: So, my journey has been as part of the labs, that's where I started after my PhD. And I worked for quite a few years in doing basic research within the labs, getting an understanding of the different elements from a lab standpoint. Then I thought I would like to try something a little different, which is to manage a lab and to work with people, and so I moved to Novartis with that intention. And for the last several years, I've essentially been managing a lab within Novartis, and I've had now changing levels of responsibility, initially it was a local Cambridge-based role, which then became a global role. We've now started to take on early discovery all the way into development as part of my responsibility. So it's been several years up to the point that I have now what I am doing right now. >> Speaker 1: Can you share some details about your educational background and what academic talents you had coming into the pharmaceutical industry?
>> Speaker 2: Sure, so I started my main foray into this space when I did my Bachelor's in Pharmaceutical Sciences, or as it was called, Bachelor's in Pharmacy.
At that time, it was a four year degree course where we learned all the different elements of essentially making drugs. And that's when I got interested in the different aspects of drug discovery and development, specifically, what piqued my interest was pharmacology. And I decided to pursue that as part of my future education, which is how I came to the United States, where I was accepted into a pharmacology program. That's when I got introduced to the amazing world of pharmacokinetics. So I initially joined in a master's program, and then eventually, I converted that and graduated with a PhD. And that is how my journey into my educational background with pharmacology, pharmacokinetics. And then I worked with this very amazing organ, which is the human placenta. And that's how I got interested about the different elements that come with metabolism because I was investigating the role of the human placenta for metabolizing drugs but also for transporting them across the maternal fetal barrier. And so that really got me very much interested in exploring this space of pharmacokinetics. >> Speaker 1: That's fascinating. When I think of metabolism, I tend to think of the liver as the powerhouse for that, but metabolism occurs in a lot of different tissues and organs. That's fantastic, thanks for sharing that. So, in your typical week or typical day, are there some routine activities that you will typically engage with in your line of work? >> Speaker 2: So lots of meetings and more meetings. So now, in my role, I am, as I mentioned, managing a group of scientists who are doing most of the work. I manage to work with them, talk through them about the scientific challenges but also anything that we run into as issues, I manage expectations, I clarify roles and responsibilities. So what I'm really trying to do mostly is to engage with the people within the group, but then also reach out to people across different line functions. Ensure that we have alignment in terms of the request, the expectations, the outputs that the department is having, in terms of the science that we do, the results, they're coming out in a timely manner. So that's pretty much most of my day-to-day activities that I engage in. >> Speaker 1: So these meetings, within pharmacokinetics, I'd imagine you are working with multiple different programs at a time. How many programs would you guess you support within your group?
>> Speaker 2: So, the way we are structured here is quite unique in a way that we support all the different modalities, all the different therapeutic areas. So we are not tied to just specific projects that we are assigned to. So we would handle anything that comes through the pipeline that we would provide support for. So there are a lot of projects, as you can imagine at Novartis, that we are supporting. So I am not specifically linked to a particular project in my role, and then there are individuals who work on specific projects, but from my standpoint, I'm essentially managing, I would say, the entire discovery and development portfolio. >> Speaker 1: And so the Cambridge site, that is the main site for pharmacokinetic studies? >> Speaker 2: So both we have a presence at Basel as well as in Cambridge, and so we work as a global team to support any kind of request from an in vitro ADME standpoint as well. >> Speaker 1: As you explore these different modalities, do you find that you have to work more closely with formulation? Is there more interdependence between people in those projects or is formulation, are you extensions of one another? But I think formulation is vitally important sometimes. >> Yes, so formulation is one of the groups that we work very closely with, in addition to some other key partners, which is our chemistry, right? So we have a lot of touch points with them. Formulation would come as the next stage when the molecule starts to look interesting. So because we provide kind of the design part of it, but then also the characterization part of it. So formulation comes in and in that space also we are early into the process, but also later into the clinic, right? So what impact it has, because at that stage, we don't have all of this figured out, but what we do know is the solubility, what we do know is the permeability. So there is some basic information that we do have that we can offer, but we are also trying to think now, creative, as I mentioned, with the complex modalities, it's not just passive permeability. There are other mechanisms and just understanding that we get into a lot of neural transporter space, even for oral absorption, even biologics, it's not oral, it's subcutaneous. So what's happening there? So there is a lot of touch points with formulation, especially when it comes to non oral deliveries as well with local administration and things like that. So quite a lot of interaction just to understand, as I mentioned, expectations, what can we deliver when our model says something, don't overly interpret that it may not be for that purpose that you think you are using it. So just educating each other on our needs. There's a lot of modeling that happens in both spaces, and we just have to be how and what can be used, how our data can essentially be feed into what they are looking for. So, yeah, we took quite a bit of interaction. >> Speaker 1: You mentioned diffusion, there was a talk, there's an American chemical society, it was an online symposium talk, and I couldn't get in because I think it was a huge hit and everybody wanted to watch it. But it was about the fallacy of passive diffusion in oral drugs, and it seemed a lot of strong statements were going to be made in this. And you kind of referred to that a little bit, everything's not passive diffusion, even in small molecules. So how important is passive diffusion? Is it still a driver, or is it sometimes not that important? >> Speaker 2: I think it depends, right, it depends on what we understand about that chemical matter. I wouldn't dismiss it as not being important, because as much as I talk about different modalities, there is still that very drug like space, okay? Where we know we're going to get oral exposure, we're going to have elimination driven through our classical hepatic sips and things like that. But then occasionally, we do come across a target that just cannot handle a normal chemical space, right, or so called drug like space. And we do have to have creative chemistry, and in that case, there are other things that could be at play. So we do run into these. Do we have a very good understanding of that? I would say, as I mentioned, we are learning about these, but it's not that it's generally applicable to every molecule or passive diffusion, is not the driver. I would say in most cases, in the kind of space that we tend to work, where oral absorption is a critical component, it's just by natural selection you're going to get to that space, because otherwise you'll just see the drug just doesn't make it in. And then you have to optimize it, you have to dial in those properties, and then, yeah, passive diffusion is an important component, and that's why we have assays that screen for it very early on. But then we also learn that where we see disconnects, and then we ask ourselves, what's going on here? Maybe there is something more to the story. So it's an evolving learning science, which space, what kind of properties, what comes in? But as I said, it's pretty much what we see as the big player. >> Speaker 1: Okay, great, thank you. So we've sort of talked about how your position supports other scientists. So you manage your team, can you talk a little bit about what you provide to teams outside your group? I think you've touched upon this a bit, but could you elaborate a bit more? >> Speaker 2: Yes, so in my role, I am really trying to facilitate these interactions. So when we talk about collaboration or working with teams outside, as you said, within my group, just ensuring these touch points, having a good understanding of what they are looking for. What do we offer, any limitations that we may have that they think we could provide that we may not, that's essentially where I'm trying to involve and engage. On a scientific standpoint also, there is the intricate science that we are doing. If there are concepts or ideas that people have, how can we kind of leverage that from their standpoint, but also then bring that to their attention or how we are providing this. So there's a lot of these kind of scientific exchanges that we have with other groups, most of this is all about making the connections, the networking. We within our labs have certain technologies that we have, and that's an expertise we can offer, but then what's out there? What are some of the other things that other groups may have come up with? So just understanding that is also an important element. So just building that connectivity, those networking opportunities, that's most of the outreach that we do. >> Speaker 1: Sounds like there's quite a bit of knowledge base building to share with different teams as they encounter problems. >> Speaker 2: Absolutely. >> Speaker 1: Can you talk about why you made the conscious decision to work for a larger pharmaceutical company rather than perhaps a smaller company?
>> Speaker 2: So it wasn't really by intention at the time. When you are graduating, you have an idea of what you are looking for, and for me, it was quite clear that I would be going to the industry. And so at that point, I was applying to a few companies that I knew, and that's how I got my first opportunity with a big pharma. And I like the culture, I like the way we have an opportunity to impact human health care. And so I just continued my journey there, not that a different setup would not be desirable at this point, but it's just something that I thought I could definitely continue and opportunities just kept coming. So from my first job, I moved on to Novartis, and again, as you see, I like it here and I definitely enjoy doing what I do. >> Speaker 1: That's great. Now, this next question is really fairly specific, and maybe you're in your position, you manage many projects, but can you talk a little bit specifically about your current work? Maybe a specific project or maybe a specific project that you facilitated and was particularly satisfying to you. And maybe the impact that work had on patients who ultimately will receive the medication. >> Speaker 2: So I sit a bit early in the whole process of drug discovery and development. And as you probably know and imagine, it takes several years before what we touch on can actually make it into the clinic. But just knowing that what we are doing is eventually going to impact human life, I think that in itself is a very satisfying feeling. So, Novartis works on multiple indications, ranging from oncology, ophthalmology, cardiovascular. So, as I mentioned, we touch all of these. What we have been working on, and this is something that I experience at Novartis, is the diversity of our portfolio. So we tend to refer these more synthetic drugs, or small molecule, low molecule, as you referred to, but then also the large molecules and the peptides, and now we hear about these cell and gene therapies. So the breadth that we get to see and experience and what we can contribute in some of these novel chemical space is a constant learning experience. And it's, in a way, also unknown territories that we get to explore. And that's really a very, very interesting feeling, is to be the first in that, to kind of learn something new in that area. So that's something that really is extremely gratifying when it comes to really transforming human life in a very different way that has not been done before. So that, I would say, is something I really feel passionate about. >> Speaker 1: That's great. You touched upon this, but can you talk about what you see as some of the big challenges, maybe in the field of pharmacokinetics that are looming on the horizon that we'll need to solve and figure out?
>> Speaker 2: So from a pharmacokinetic standpoint, what we provide from the early part all the way into clinic is these translational or predictive abilities for our models or our systems that we use. And we are seeing that our chemical space is getting, as I mentioned, very diverse, our modalities are getting more and more what we call complex. And so keeping up with that in terms of the science as it is evolving in real-time and making these predictions and coming up with these translational models that can be used for decision making, that's a challenge in real-time. And so we are doing our best to keep up with it, but we also understand there are limitations. We may not be ready today to provide answers for the kind of questions we are getting, either from a dose standpoint, so the pharmacokinetic aspect or the exposure aspect. So we are also providing insights into drug interactions. So what does our drug have an impact or some other drug? And these are questions which require a very good mechanistic understanding of the compound, its disposition in the body. And we are, as I said, as much as expertise the field has, it's a learning process right now, as I mentioned, with the complex modalities. So that's a challenge, and we are, as I said, working towards making our models a lot more translatable and predictive as much as we can. >> Speaker 1: Fantastic. Sujal, thank you so much for sharing your time and being available for this interview and sharing your experience with the participants in this course. >> Speaker 2: Great, thank you for having me. >> Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely, my pleasure. Take care. >> Speaker 2: Thank you.
