# Module 3

## Plasma Protein Binding

### Learning objectives

- Define plasma protein binding (PPB)
- List the most relevant proteins for PPB
- Describe the importance of measuring PPB

### Plasma protein binding (PPB)

- **Plasma protein** + **drug** (free, unbound) ↔ **plasma-drug protein** (bound)
  
- **Human plasma protein content**: 60-80 mg/mL
  - 50-60% **albumin**: binds acidic & neutral drugs
  - 3% **α1-acid glycoprotein**: binds basic drugs

### Why measure PPB?

**Free drug hypothesis**:  
\[ C_p (\text{unbound}) = \text{unbound concentration at site of action} \]

- PPB can affect drug disposition (distribution).
- PPB can affect clearance.
- PPB can vary among preclinical species and may be affected by disease states.
- Knowing PPB assists in human dose prediction and evaluating safety margin.

### Measuring PPB

- **Three common methods for PPB measurement**:
  - Equilibrium dialysis
  - Ultrafiltration
  - Ultracentrifugation

- **Relationships of values**:
  - \( f_u \): fraction unbound
  - \( C_p = C_p \) (bound) + \( C_p \) (unbound)
  - \( C_p \) (unbound) = \( C_p \times f_u \)

### PPB considerations

- **Interspecies PPB variability**:
  - \( f_u = 0.016 \) in human
  - \( f_u = 0.60 \) in dog
  - 40-fold difference

- **Concentration effects**:
  - PPB can be saturated at higher \( C_p \)
  - \( f_u = 0.1 \) at lower \( C_p \)
  - \( f_u = 0.5 \) at higher \( C_p \)
