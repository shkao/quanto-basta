By the end of this video, you'll be able to define a PK/PD relationship. You will be able to list the roles of PK/PD studies during drug discovery. You will also be able to distinguish between a direct and indirect PK/PD relationship. Pharmacokinetics, PK, is often described as what the body does to the drug, comprising absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. It can be captured by a concentration, time curve as shown in the upper left graph. Pharmacodynamics, PD, can be described as what the drug does to the body. PD is often quantified using biomarkers as indicators of the biological effects of the drug. Biomarkers can range from electrical signals in the millisecond range to enzymes changing over hours to tumor size changing over weeks or months. A drug's PD is captured by an effect, time curve as shown in the upper right hand graph. PK/PD then is the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics linking concentration, effect, and time, as shown in the bottom graph. PK/PD evolves throughout the drug development process. During pre-clinical phases, PK/PD can be used to design pharmacology studies, select the best compound, ensure target engagement, and predict PK/PD for humans. In clinical phases, PK/PD can be used to define PK/PD sampling times and to find the efficacious dose and dosing frequency in human. There are two basic types of PK/PD relationships, direct and indirect. Let's start with a direct relationship. A direct effect is a simple relationship with no time delay between PK/PD. This relationship can be seen in the upper right-hand plot, where the blue line represents concentration, and the red line, the effect or response. The two lines move simultaneously with effect, increasing indirect relation to concentration, and both concentration and affect peak at the same time. This relationship can then be captured as a classical E_max curve shown in the bottom right plot, where concentration and effect are plotted to determine an EC50. The second relationship is an indirect relationship. This relationship is more complex and shows a delay between PK/PD. As seen in the top graph, drug concentration typically peaks first, with the drug effect peaking at a later time point. The observed time delay can be due to several factors, such as time for the drug to distribute from blood to the target site, presence of an active metabolite, the PDM point, maybe part of a cascade or a downstream marker or effect, or there may be up or down-regulation of the receptor. In this situation, plotting the response or effect against concentration in the lower-left gives what's called a hysteresis curve, a mathematical or PK/PD model can collapse the hysteresis curve to generate a dose-response relationship and determine an EC50. Understanding a PK/PD relationship requires multiple studies. One example is a dose fractionation study, which can address whether the PD is driven by C_max or AUC. Those fractionation studies require two groups. Group 1, shown in blue on the graph, and Group 2 in red. Group 1 receives a single dose, whereas Group 2 receives a fractionated dose which is administered three times. This achieves the same AUC as observed for the blue group, yet with a different C_max. In this type of study, if the PD effect is unchanged, then the effect is AUC-driven. If the PD effect is lower in Group 2, then the effect is C_max-driven. AUC-driven effects are more commonly observed than C_max-driven effects, however, this depends on the drug type and mechanism of action. Other drivers of PD exist, but they are outside the scope of our discussion. We have now defined a PK/PD relationship while describing how the understanding of PK/PD relationships contribute to drug discovery. We focused on the two most common types of PK/PD relationships, direct and indirect, and discussed how to distinguish between C_max and AUC-driven pharmacodynamics.
