By the end of this video, you'll be able to define plasma protein binding, PPB. You will also be able to list the proteins that are most responsible for PPB. Finally, you will be able to describe the importance of measuring PPB. Plasma protein binding or PPB is one of the key PK parameters. PPB is the degree to which a drug is bound to proteins present in the blood. Plasma is the protein rich fraction of the blood, and hence, it is used to determine the extent of drug protein binding. The protein content of plasma is around 60-80 milligram per milliliter. Approximately 60% of the protein is albumin. Albumin tends to bind acidic and neutral drugs. Approximately 3% is Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, which tends to bind basic drugs. There are many other plasma proteins, but these two are among the most important for drug binding. There are many reasons for understanding PPB. The free drug hypothesis states that at steady state, the concentration of unbound drug in plasma is the same as that at the site of action. PPB affects drug disposition as only unbound drug can cross membranes. Most clearance mechanisms only affect unbound drug. PPB can vary across different pre-clinical species and can even be influenced by the disease state of a patient. Therefore, a thorough understanding of a compound's PPB can improve the accuracy of dose predictions, and help evaluate safety risks. The commonly utilized techniques for determining plasma protein binding are, equilibrium dialysis, ultrafiltration, and ultracentrifugation. Measuring plasma protein binding gives us the fraction of drug that is unbound in plasma. The unbound or free fraction is represented as f_u. C_p is total plasma concentration, and includes the concentrations of both the bound and unbound drug. The concentration of unbound drug is calculated as the product of the total drug concentration and the unbound fraction, that is C_p unbound= C_p, that is C_p total Ã— f_u. Unbound fraction is a key pharmacokinetic parameter. There is no ideal value for unbound fraction. Safe effective drugs with high and low unbound fraction values, even less than 1% unbound exist. Therefore, PPB is rarely a factor in choosing a drug candidate. Understanding PPB however, is critical for predicting dosing and assessing safety risks. On this slide are examples that illustrate factors that can influence PPB. First, cross-species differences in PPB. Cefpiramide is an antibiotic, and it typically has an unbound fraction of 0.016, 1.6% in humans, and 0.6 in dogs. That is a 40-fold difference. Assuming similar PPB between pre-clinical species and human may result in over or underestimation of several factors, including the relationship between the PK of a drug and its pharmacodynamics, the anticipated human dose or the safety margins. Hence, it is important to account for species differences in PPB. For most drugs, PPB is constant across a range of clinically relevant concentrations. However, for some drugs, high plasma concentration can result in saturation of binding sites of the plasma protein and consequently increasing unbound fraction. Disopyramide, an antiarrhythmic drug is an example of a drug that shows concentration dependent PPB. At low concentrations, the unbound fraction is about 0.1, so 90% of the drug is bound. At high concentrations, the unbound fraction may be as high as 0.5. Other factors that can contribute to differences in PPB include age, sex, pregnancy, fed fasted state, diet, blood pH, blood lipid profile, renal and hepatic impairment, and other disease states such as inflammation or cancer. These are important considerations for the drug hunting team to characterize once a candidate drug is in the clinic. We have now covered plasma protein binding. The unbound fraction of a drug in plasma is a key pharmacokinetic parameter that must be well understood to facilitate accurate dose and safety margin predictions.
