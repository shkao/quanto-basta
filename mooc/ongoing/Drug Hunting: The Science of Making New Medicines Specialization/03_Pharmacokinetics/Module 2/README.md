### ADME properties

| Type              | A (Absorption)                                 | D (Distribution)                            | M (Metabolism)                             | E (Excretion)                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Small molecules    | - Membrane permeable                          | - Diffuses into various tissues             | - Subject to metabolic enzymes             | - Subject to renal excretion               |
|                   | - Often orally available                      | - Variable Vd                               | - Variable CLh                             | - Variable CLr                             |
| Biologics          | - Very low permeability                       | - Confined to plasma & interstitial fluid   | - Minimal metabolism                       | - Not renally excreted                     |
|                   | - Not orally available                        | - Low Vd                                    | - Very low CLh                             | - Very low CLr                             |

### Consequences on half-life

- **Small molecules**
  - Ibrutinib: PO daily, T₁/₂ = 4–6 h
  - Lenalidomide: PO daily, T₁/₂ = 3–5 h
- **Biologics**
  - Pembrolizumab: IV infusion every 3 or 6 weeks, T₁/₂ = 22 d
  - Dulaglutide: SC injection every week, T₁/₂ = 5 d

### Immunogenicity

- Small molecules typically do not elicit an adaptive immune response.
- Biologics, as foreign proteins, can trigger an immune response.
- Immunogenicity leads to potential pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety risks that must be monitored.

## Phase I & Phase II Metabolism

### Learning objectives

- Differentiate phase I and phase II metabolism
- List major metabolic enzymes

### Physiological role of drug metabolism

- **Drug metabolism** – defense system of organisms.
- **Xenobiotics** – substances foreign to an organism.
- Metabolism reduces toxicity & facilitates excretion.
  
  Xenobiotics (drugs) → *metabolic pathways* → Metabolites → *excretion*
  
- Metabolism affects drug clearance and exposure.

### Phase I metabolism

- **Phase I reactions** – oxidations, reductions, hydrolyses.
- Phase I reactions are catalyzed by enzymes.

#### Oxidation & Reduction

- CYP450 superfamily:
  - 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4/5
- Monoamine oxidases (MAOs)

#### Hydrolysis

- Various esterases & lipases

### Phase II metabolism

- **Phase II reactions** – conjugation reactions.
- These reactions add a polar group onto the parent drug or its metabolite.

#### Key enzyme classes

- **UGT (UDP-glucuronyl transferase)** – adds a glucuronic acid.
- **SULT (sulfotransferase)** – forms a sulfate.

## Additional Aspects of Metabolism

### Learning objectives

- Describe the fate of metabolites
- List reasons for variability in metabolic clearance

### Fate of metabolites

- The **liver** is the primary site of most drug metabolism.
- Liver and **GI tract metabolism** affect bioavailability.
- Metabolism can occur in any tissues that express metabolic enzymes (e.g., liver, kidneys, and lung).
- Metabolites are normally excreted in **urine via the kidneys** or **feces via the gall bladder**.
- Some drugs may be excreted unchanged in urine.

### Metabolic clearance can vary

- **Metabolic enzyme expression** levels vary across species, as does clearance.
- On a **per-mass basis**, smaller species have higher metabolic clearance than larger species.
- **Variability among humans** is often related to differences in genetics, health, and organ function, especially the liver and kidneys.
- **Behavior** (e.g., smoking) can also be a factor.

### Drugs can influence metabolism

- **Metabolic enzymes** can break down drugs.
- Drugs bind to the active sites of metabolic enzymes.
- Can a drug interfere with a metabolic enzyme? **Yes**
- Can one drug affect the metabolism of another drug? **Yes**

#### Drug-drug interaction (DDI)

- **DDIs** are possible if patients take multiple drugs.

## Metabolic Stability & Clearance

### Learning objectives

- Describe metabolic stability assays
- Outline how clearance is predicted
- Connect metabolic stability to dose size and frequency

### Importance of metabolic clearance

- **Hits and leads** are screened using in vitro metabolic stability assays.
- **Phase I metabolism** involves oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis.
- **Phase II metabolism** involves conjugation reactions.
- **Hepatic CYP450** oxidative metabolism is crucial for the clearance of more than 50% of marketed drugs.

### Liver microsomal stability assays

- These assays **measure compound stability** in liver microsomes in the presence of cofactors such as **NADPH**, which is necessary for the metabolic reactions.
- The graph shows **% parent compound remaining** over time, which helps calculate the **rate of elimination**.
- The **intrinsic clearance (CLint)** is determined by the formula:
  
  \[
  CL_{\text{int}} = \frac{\text{rate of elimination}}{\text{microsomal concentration}}
  \]

### From CL\(_\text{int}\) to in vivo CL prediction

1. **In vitro apparent CL\(_\text{int}\)** (µL/min/mg): The rate of intrinsic clearance is determined in vitro.
2. **In vitro scaled CL\(_\text{int}\)** (mL/min/kg): Using scaling factors, such as microsomal protein per gram of liver and liver weight per body weight, intrinsic clearance is scaled.
3. **In vivo predicted CL** (mL/min/kg): Through a translational model, this scaled value predicts in vivo clearance.

The formula for **hepatic clearance (CL)** is given as:
\[
\text{hepatic CL} = Q \cdot \left( \frac{f_u \cdot CL_\text{int}}{Q + f_u \cdot CL_\text{int}} \right)
\]
where \(Q\) is liver blood flow and \(f_u\) is the fraction of unbound drug.

### Dose size and dose frequency

- **Potency**: Refers to the strength of the drug and its effectiveness at a certain concentration.
- **Clearance**: The rate at which a drug is removed from the body.
- **Volume of distribution**: How extensively the drug spreads throughout the body tissues.
- **Absorption**: The process by which the drug enters the bloodstream from its administration site.

All of these factors are influenced by **metabolic stability**, which affects how frequently a drug needs to be dosed and in what amount. Drugs with low metabolic stability are cleared quickly, requiring higher or more frequent dosing.

## Membranes, Permeability, & Transporters

### Learning objectives

- Describe membrane permeability assays
- Relate in vitro assay results to in vivo properties
- List selected important transporter proteins

### Membranes & drugs

#### Membranes

- Vital for compartmentalization in biological systems.
- Can impair absorption and distribution of drugs.

#### In vitro permeability assay types

- **PAMPA** – Parallel artificial membrane permeability assay.
- **Caco-2** – Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells.
- **MDCK** – Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.

### Permeability assays

- The diagram shows a typical setup for a permeability assay, where a **donor** chamber contains a drug (represented by red dots) that must cross a cell layer to reach the **acceptor** chamber.
- The **P\(_\text{app}\)** (apparent permeability) is calculated to quantify how easily the drug passes through the membrane, and it is typically expressed in cm/s (×10⁶). This value helps in determining the absorption and transport characteristics of the drug across biological membranes.

### Permeability & absorption

- **P\(_\text{app}\)** is used to predict **f\(_a\)** (fraction absorbed).
- **f\(_a\)**: Fraction of drug absorbed into systemic circulation.
- **f\(_g\)**: Fraction escaping gut metabolism.
- **f\(_h\)**: Fraction escaping hepatic metabolism.

The overall bioavailability (**F**) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
F = f\_a \times f\_g \times f\_h
\]

The graph shows a relationship between the **apparent permeability (P\(_\text{app}\))** from Caco-2 assays and the **fraction absorbed** (%), indicating how permeability influences drug absorption.

### Transporters

- MDR: multidrug resistance protein
- MRP: multidrug resistant associated protein
- OATP: organic anionic transporting polypeptides
- BCRP: breast cancer resistant protein
- OCT: organic cation transporters
