By the conclusion of this video, you will be able to describe the design of common types of membrane permeability assays. You will be able to relate the in vitro assay results to in vivo PK properties. Finally, you will be able to list the transporter proteins most likely to affect absorption and distribution of potential drugs. Membranes are vital in biology for allowing compartmentalization within an organism. Membranes also happened to pose a barrier for both drug absorption and distribution. Understanding how well a molecule can cross membranes, a property called membrane permeability, is critically important for the drug-hunting team. In vitro membrane permeability assessment tools like PAMPA, which is based on an artificial membrane, or Caco-2 cells, which are a human epithelial colorectal cell line, and the canine kidney cell line or MDCK are commonly used to quantify permeability. The permeability of a molecule is frequently measured using a two-chambered apparatus. The two chambers are separated by a permeable support layered with an artificial lipid membrane or cell monolayer. The test compound is placed in the donor chamber and its appearance in the acceptor chamber is measured. The appearance and the acceptor chamber as a function of time is related to the permeability of the compound. Highly permeable compounds appear in the acceptor chamber at a faster rate than poorly permeable compounds. The rate of appearance of the compound is known as the apparent permeability and is often reported in centimeters per second times 10^6. The apparent permeability can be related to the extent to which a compound can permeate a cell or the extent to which it crosses a barrier epithelium like the intestine or blood-brain barrier. This is typically done by establishing a relationship between the apparent permeability and in vivo measurement, such as that shown on this slide for apparent permeability and the human fraction absorbed. This correlation can be used to estimate the fraction absorbed f_a in human based on apparent permeability. The product of the fraction absorbed along with the fraction escaping gut and hepatic metabolism, abbreviated as f_g and f_h respectively, constitutes the drug's bioavailability F. Permeability assays are used to select compounds for further studies by enabling project teams to identify compounds with sufficient permeability to have a suitably high fraction absorbed in the gut and enable adequate oral exposure. In such cases, high permeability and a correspondingly higher fraction absorbed is frequently desired. Permeability assays also provide insight into the potential mechanism of clearance, where highly permeable molecules are predominantly cleared by metabolism and poorly permeable molecules may also be cleared by transporters in the liver and kidney. Molecules often cross membranes by passive diffusion. The transporter proteins often also play an important role. The transporter mediated transmembrane flux of a compound can be measured using cells that express one or more transporters of interest, and the movement of the compound is quantified in much the same way as the permeability assays. These black circles are meant to represent a possible transporter protein. Some key transporters of interest to a drug-hunting team are the multi-drug resistance proteins, multi-drug resistant associated proteins, organic anionic transporting polypeptides, breast cancer resistance protein, and organic cation transporters. Correlation of in vitro transporter data to in vivo properties is challenging due to broad tissue and cell type distribution of specific transporters. This can result in the need for multiple in vitro models by tissue and by transporter. Correlation is further challenging in that most in vitro models do not adequately replicate the in vivo condition. To date, translating transporter data from in vitro to in vivo has yielded mixed results in the field with no commonly accepted practice. One example, however, of a correlative success is that relationship between in vitro MDR1 transporter activity and in vivo brain penetration. MDR1 limits brain penetration of drugs, so high MDR1 efflux ratio against the compound with the brain indication may be undesirable. This type of information can help the selection of compounds most likely to have favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. We have now described in vitro membrane permeability assays and how the results can assist in their prediction of in vivo absorption and distribution properties. We have also listed some common transporter proteins that facilitate transmembrane flux.
