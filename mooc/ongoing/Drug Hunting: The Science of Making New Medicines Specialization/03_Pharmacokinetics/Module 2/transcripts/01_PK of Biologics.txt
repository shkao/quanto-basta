By the end of this video, you will be able to contrast the ADME properties of biologics against those of small molecules. You will also be able to connect the ADME properties of biologics to how they are administered and dosed. On the screen are names of four different highly successful drugs, two, ibrutinib and lenalidomide are considered small molecule drugs. Note the molecular weights of these drugs are relatively small. Small molecules typically have a molecular weight under 1,000 g/mol, often less than 500 g/mol. The other two drugs are biologic drugs, dulaglutide and pembrolizumab. These drugs consists of proteins and therefore their molecular weights are listed in the manner of proteins. Dulaglutide is a fusion protein with a molecular weight of 63 kilodaltons, the same as 63,000 g/mol. Pembrolizumab is actually an antibody huge with a massive 149 kilodaltons. In addition, these biologics are made of naturally occurring amino acids, while the small molecule drugs are organic, non naturally occurring xenobiotic compounds. The difference is in molecular weight, as well as their chemical makeup have a large effect on the ADME properties of these drugs. Let's look at these ADME differences. For absorption, small molecules tend to have higher membrane permeability, which favors oral absorption. Biologics have poor membrane permeability and oral bioavailability. Because biologics do not cross membranes, they are confined to the plasma and interstitial fluids and have low volume of distribution. Unlike small molecules, biologics are too large to enter liver cells, so they're hepatic clearance is essentially negligible. Likewise, renal clearance is also not a major elimination pathway because proteins are too large to be filtered by the kidneys. What is typically observed, especially in the case of monoclonal antibodies, is clearance via intracellular lysosome will proteolytic degradation. Finally, biologics that are monoclonal antibodies are fusions of a therapeutic antibody also undergo a process called Fc recycling that extra greatly extend serum half-life of these molecules. Let's see how these differences in volume of distribution and clearance effect these drugs. In the upper right corner is the formula for calculating half-life from volume of distribution and clearance. Ibrutinib and lenalidomide or both once a day oral drugs. The volume of distribution and clearance for oral drugs vary but they often work out to give a half-life in the range of 4-16 hours. Now look at the biologics. Both have a tiny clearance to give a very long half-life, 22 days for pembrolizumab and five days for dulaglutide. Pembrolizumab is not orally available and must be administered by IV infusion. This administration is inconvenient for the patient, but the long half-life allows a three or six-week window between doses. Dulaglutide also is not orally available and it must be administered through subcutaneous injection. With a long half-life, patients can go a week or more between doses. The high molecular weight of biologics has a large effect, arguably an advantageous effect on some ADME properties. However, the high molecular weight of biologics also carries potential PK and safety risks. Small molecules normally do not interact with the immune system. The biologics are often large foreign proteins that can trigger an immune response. For most biologics, with the exception of vaccines and immune response is undesirable and can lead to rapid degradation or inactivation of the therapeutic negating any benefit to the patient. In rare cases, an anaphylactic reaction is also possible, representing an important safety risk. Both these risks can be mitigated by constructing the biologic in such a way that is either identical to or closely resembles a human protein. Given these immunogenicity risks are species dependent. Biologics are often assessed in non-human primate models. Although the immune response in non-human primate does not predict a similar risk in humans, the consequences of an immune response can inform the human situation. Since immunogenicity can be a challenge for biologics, it must be closely monitored during pre-clinical and clinical phases of drug discovery and development. We have now described how ADME properties differ between small molecules and biologics and how these differences affect the administration, dosing, efficacy, and safety of biologics.
