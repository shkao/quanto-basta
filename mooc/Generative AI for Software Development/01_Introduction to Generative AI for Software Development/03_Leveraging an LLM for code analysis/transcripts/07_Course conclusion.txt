I hope you've
enjoyed this course, and you've come a long way. You started by looking
at what AI is and how machine learning enables you to build artificially
intelligent applications. From there, you looked at how machine learning
lets you do this, exploring the
different types of ML. This led to an understanding
of transformers, the technology that
underpins generative AI, such as large language models. One part of generative AI is its ability to generate
and analyze source code, and you explored how
to leverage that with many software engineering
tasks beyond just coding from documentation to debugging, and a whole lot more. You then dug into prompting, and how with a little
work on your prompts, you can get the best
out of the model, things like being specific, or having the LLM adopt a role, or bringing your own expertise
to the table to guide it, providing feedback to
help it do better. You then used data structures as a great example of putting
these skills into practice, taking very basic and fundamental computer
science concepts, but stretching them into
production scenarios, understanding how to scale,
assess vulnerabilities, limitations in their
implementation, security issues, and
a whole lot more. This stuff is also
really useful for software engineering
interviews and you're really only
getting started. In this specialization, we'll do a lot more digging into using an LLM as your assistant to
be a much better developer, including using
and scaling data, understanding testing
and test cases, and a whole lot more. I'm so excited to share this
journey with you. Thank you.
