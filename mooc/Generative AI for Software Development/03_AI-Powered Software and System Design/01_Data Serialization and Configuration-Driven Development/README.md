# Module 1: Data Serialization and Configuration-Driven Development

## Module introduction

### Configuration-driven development (CDD)

* Behavior, features and settings of an application are controlled by external configuration files
* More flexible software
* Non-technical teammates can modify the application

### Module overview

* Configuration-driven development overview
* Data serialization in Python and configuration file formats
* Design an app to use the DALL-E API using CDD
* Serialize output

## Configuration-driven development overview

### Design paradigms

* Structured approach to software architecture and organization
* Some are baked into popular tools
* Others are supported in tools, but optional

### Brainstorming design paradigms

**Prompt:** You are an expert on software design paradigms. I am working on building a simple Python-based app that will make calls to the DALL-E API and generate images for users.

The application will be deployed in many different contexts and configurations depending on the end users, and I want my less technical colleagues to be able to do some customization without editing the code itself.

What high-level software design paradigms should I consider for this project?

### Configuration-driven development overview

* Behavior controlled through external configuration files  
  * e.g. JSON or YAML

* Benefits  
  * Non-technical teammates can change application  
  * Flexible software for many environments  
  * Reduce bugs  

* Drawbacks  
  * Potential complexity from many configuration files  
  * Debugging is more complicated  
  * Potential security risks

## Choosing a configuration file format

### Prompting best practices

* **Be specific:** Provide detail and context about your problem
* **Assign a role:** Assign a role to tailor the output you receive
* **Request an expert opinion:** Assign an expert role and ask the LLM to evaluate the work youâ€™ve already done to further refine it
* **Give feedback:** Iteratively prompt the LLM and provide feedback on the output you receive to get closer to your expected results

### JSON vs YAML

**JSON**  

* Support across many languages  
* No comment support  
* Verbose  

**YAML**  

* High readable  
* Supports comments  
* Potentially error-prone

## JSON and pickle

### Comparisons

* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
  * Text-based, human-readable format for data exchange.
  * Supported across multiple programming languages.
  * Common commands:
    * `json.dump()`: Serialize Python object to a file.
    * `json.load()`: Deserialize data from a file.
    * `json.dumps()`: Serialize to a JSON string.
    * `json.loads()`: Deserialize from a JSON string.

* **Pickle**
  * Python-specific binary format for serializing complex objects.
  * Can serialize custom objects, functions, and nested structures.
  * Common commands:
    * `pickle.dump()`: Serialize to a binary file.
    * `pickle.load()`: Deserialize from a binary file.
    * `pickle.dumps()`: Serialize to a byte stream.
    * `pickle.loads()`: Deserialize from a byte stream.
  * **Security Risk**: Avoid unpickling untrusted data, as it can execute malicious code.

* **When to Use?**
  * Use **JSON** for readability and cross-language compatibility.
  * Use **Pickle** for complex Python objects and internal Python applications.

## Using the DALL-E API

### Code to call DALL-E

**Prompt:** You are a deep expert on the OpenAI ecosystem, including the client libraries, REST endpoints, and any other way of accessing functionality of GPT, DALL-E, and other models.

Please create easy to read, easy to follow code that will call DALL-E to generate an image. The code should be in Python, and all parameters should be in an external file that the Python code reads.

Please use the most up-to-date design pattern.

## Implementing CDD

### Externalizing parameters

**Prompt:** Can you modify this code to fix two issues:

First, regardless of how many images we ask for, you only parse out 1 image from the response data.

Second, can you download the images from the URL and save them locally. Add the desired filename to the JSON file, and save them as `<filename>1.PNG`, `<filename>2.PNG` etc.

### Adding a timeout

**Prompt:** Update the configuration file and app code to include a timeout for the API calls.

## Serializing results

### Adding parameters and serializing results

**Prompt:** Can you make 2 more modifications:

First, can you add the style and quality parameters to the payload configuration, and load them to pass to the backend?

Then, after the files are downloaded, can you pickle them up along with the configuration file?
