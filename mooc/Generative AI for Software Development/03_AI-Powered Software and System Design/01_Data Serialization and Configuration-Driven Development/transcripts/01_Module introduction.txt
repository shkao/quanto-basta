In this module, I'll walk
you through how you can use an LLM to help design the
architecture of an application. Starting from an initial
concept and working up to building a simple
functioning prototype. The methodology that
you'll explore is configuration-driven
development, or CDD. This is an approach
to building software where the behavior
features and settings of an application are
controlled through external configuration
files rather than hard coded within the
applications core logic. This approach enhances
software flexibility in response to changing
requirements and can allow non technical team
members to modify certain aspects of the
application's behavior without code changes. We're going to be
looking at file serialization as part of this. While I've been a part of successful engineering
projects using CDD. The goal of this module is not to convince you to
use CDD in your work. Instead, I want you to see an example of how an
LLM can help you select and implement a design paradigm that broadly impacts
a software project. This module and this course is aimed to help you consider
the ways that LLMs can help you with major design
choices like this one and I think CDD is a great
first example to explore. You'll start with an overview
of CDD so that you can understand the overall approach and its strengths
and weaknesses. Next, you'll get a quick
refresher about how to read, write, and serialize
data in Python. CDD depends on reading and writing from
configuration files, and this will also be an
opportunity to practice using a library that you may
not have touched for a while with the help of an LLM. Next, you'll partner
with the LLM to structure a sample project
using CDD approach. This project uses the
image generation model DALL-E to, well,
generate images. We've been very focused on
LLMs in this specialization, so I think you'll enjoy seeing a different type of
generative AI in action. With the help of an LLM, you'll also design the
code in a CDD style, externalizing parameters
in configuration files that add flexibility to
the design of the project. You'll also be able to serialize
the outputs of your app, making it easy for you to manage and share the images
that you generate. I think this is a fun project, and it's a good opportunity to reflect on how an
LLM can help you approach and consider those bigger design
questions in your projects. With that, join me in the
next video to get started.
