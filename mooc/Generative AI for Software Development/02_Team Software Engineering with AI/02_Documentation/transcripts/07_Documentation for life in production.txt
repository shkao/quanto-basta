So you've been taking a deep dive on
documentation in this module, and maybe deeper than you have in a long time. And I hope you'll agree that good
documentation can really transform your code. From short inline comments to well-crafted
documentation comments that help you build extensive doc pages, comments make
your code easier to read and understand. And hopefully you've come away feeling
confident that LLMs can help you do this critical work quickly and effectively. With an LLM as your documentation partner, there's no reason to write
bad documentation ever again. There's one last benefit of good
documentation that I do think is worth emphasizing. It really helps your code function
well in production settings. If your code is readable and
well explained with good doc strings and comments, it will be easier to maintain, and your engineering team will be able to
quickly understand what your code does, leading to faster bug fixes and
faster updates. And for your colleagues in tech support or
education roles, like developer advocates, your well-written documentation
will make it much easier for them to learn how to use your code and
also get users excited about it. Lastly, as we all know, code is like
a living thing because the ecosystem it lives in, cloud infrastructure,
module dependencies, web specifications, and so on, are constantly changing. Your code will probably require frequent
refactoring once in production to keep up with these changing dependencies. Good documentation will make that
process so much smoother for you and for anybody else working with your code. In fact, when it comes to dependencies,
LLMs are really useful for working through issues related to package version control,
library dependencies, and so on. And that's exactly what you're going
to focus on in the final module of this course. So let's move on to the next video to
start exploring dependency management with large language models.
