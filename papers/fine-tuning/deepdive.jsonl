Here, we**\n**sequence 65 diverse human genomes and build 130 haplotype-resolved assemblies (130**\n**[Mbp median continuity), closing 92% of all previous assembly gaps](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj+2eAvI)** **and reaching**\n**telomere-to-telomere (T2T) status for 39% of the chromosomes. We highlight complete**\n**sequence continuity of complex loci, including the major histocompatibility complex**\n**(MHC), SMN1/SMN2, NBPF8, and AMY1/AMY2, and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural**\n**variants** **(SVs).** **In** **addition,** **we** **completely** **assemble** **and** **validate** **1,246** **human**\n\n**centromeres. We find up to 30-fold variation in \u03b1-satellite high-order repeat (HOR) array**\n**length and characterize the pattern of mobile element insertions into \u03b1-satellite HOR**\n**arrays. While most centromeres predict a single site of kinetochore attachment,**\n**epigenetic analysis suggests the presence of two hypomethylated regions for 7% of**\n**[centromeres. Combining our data with the draft pangenome reference](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj)** **significantly**\n**[enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling whole-genome inference](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/79YCm)**\n\n**to a median quality value (QV) of 45. Using this approach, 26,115 SVs per sample are**\n**detected, substantially increasing the number of SVs now amenable to downstream**\n**disease association studies.**\n\n\n-----\n\n# Introduction\n\nGenome assemblies based on highly accurate long reads, e.g., Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)\nhigh-fidelity (HiFi) reads, now almost completely resolve human genomes with excellent\nsequence quality and [contiguity.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/YiyOJ+QvuIC) This technology has enabled the comprehensive\n\ncharacterization of structural variants (SVs), defined as variants 50 bp in length or longer, and\n[revealed that more than half of all SVs are missed using short-read discovery. Such genome](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy)\nassemblies have made a first draft human pangenome reference possible, which was\nconstructed by building a graph representation reflecting an alignment of haplotype-resolved\n[genome assemblies.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj)\n\nDespite these advances, genome assemblies based on a single long-read sequencing\ntechnology are presently not able to contiguously assemble whole chromosomes, resulting in\n[systematic gaps at difficult loci. Closing these gaps requires combining the complementary](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2eAvI)\nstrengths of PacBio HiFi reads (~18 kbp in length and high base-level accuracy) and ultra-long\n(UL) Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads (>100 kbp in length but with lower base-level\naccuracy). Combining both types of reads yielded the first gapless assembly of a human\n[genome](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/m0xQz) and, since then, the hybrid assembly process has been automated with the tools\n[Verkko](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/kRuB4) [and hifiasm (UL), but so far assemblies of this quality have been restricted to few](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/GofTV)\nindividual samples. Here, we target a diverse set of 65 samples predominantly from the 1000\n[Genomes Project (1kGP) cohort](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/eCV2j) and assemble 39% of chromosomes to telomere-to-telomere\n(T2T) status. This set of haplotype-resolved hybrid assemblies provides a genomic resource\nthat routinely closes more than 92% of gaps previously characterized in PacBio HiFi-only\n[assemblies. Moreover, our high-quality assemblies enable insights into many structurally](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2eAvI)\nvariable but previously intractable regions of the human genome, including centromeres and\ndisease-associated regions [e.g., major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1/SMN2, and\n_AMY1/AMY2]._\n\n# Results\n\n## Production of 130 phased genome assemblies\n\n#### Data production\nWe selected 65 human samples spanning five continental groups and 28 population groups for\nsequencing (Fig. 1a). These samples include 63 from the 1kGP, one from the International\n[HapMap Project, and another from the Genome in a Bottle effort. The complete set is](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ycIwl)\ncomposed of 30 males and 35 females of either African (n=30), Admixed American (n=9),\nEuropean (n=8), East Asian (n=10) or South Asian (n=8) descent and includes three\nparent\u2013child trios (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nWe compiled a rich data resource to produce haplotype-resolved genome assemblies and\ncapture large SVs, complex loci, and other genomic features (Methods). We generated ~47-fold\ncoverage of PacBio HiFi and ~56-fold coverage of ONT (~36-fold ultra-long) long reads on\naverage per sample (Extended Data Fig. 1a,1b; Supplementary Table 2). In addition, we\n\n\n-----\n\nperformed single-cell template strand sequencing (Strand-seq) (Supplementary Table 2),\nBionano Genomics optical mapping (Supplementary **Table** **3),** Hi-C sequencing\n\n(Supplementary Tables 4,5), isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq; Supplementary Table 6), and\nRNA sequencing (RNA-seq; Supplementary Table 7).\n\n#### Assembly\n[We generated haplotype-resolved assemblies from all 65 diploid samples using Verkko](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/kRuB4) as a\ncurrent state-of-the-art approach for hybrid genome assembly (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Tables\n**[1,2; Methods). The phasing signal for the assembly process was produced with Graphasing,](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/DeVEa)**\nleveraging Strand-seq to globally phase assembly graphs at a quality on par with trio-based\n[workflows](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/DeVEa) (Methods). This approach can, therefore, be applied to samples without parental\nsequencing data, which enabled us to cover all 26 populations from the 1kGP by including\nsamples that are not part of a family trio. The resulting set of 130 haploid assemblies is highly\ncontiguous (median area under the Nx curve [auN] of 137 Mbp, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table\n**8) and accurate at the base-pair level (median QV between 54 and 61, Fig. 1c, Supplementary**\n**[Table 9, Methods). Using established methods, we estimate the assemblies to be 99%](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Jh5SQ)**\ncomplete (median) for known single-copy genes (Extended Data Fig. 1c, Supplementary\n**Table 10). Combining two complementary long-read technologies also enabled us to reliably**\n[assemble and close 92% of previously reported gaps in PacBio HiFi-only assemblies](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2eAvI)\n\n(Supplementary Figs. 1,2; Supplementary Table 11) (Methods) and fully resolve biomedically\nimportant regions, such as the MHC locus for 128/130 assembled haplotypes.\n\nWe integrated a range of quality control (QC) annotations for each assembly using established\n[tools such as Flagger, NucFreq, Merqury, and Inspector](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) (Supplementary Figs. 3,4;\n**Supplementary Tables 12,13) to compute robust error estimates for each assembled base**\n(Supplementary Tables 14-17, Methods). We, thus, estimate that 99.6% of the phased\nsequence (median) has been assembled correctly (Supplementary Table 18). For the three\n[family trios in our dataset (SH032, Y117, PR05), we assessed the parental support for the](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/eCV2j)\nrespective haplotypes in the child\u2019s assembly via assembly-to-assembly alignments and found\nthat a median of 99.8% of all sequence assembled in contigs >100 kbp are supported by one\nparent assembly (Supplementary Table 19, Methods). In total, Verkko assembled 599\nchromosomes as a single gapless contig from telomere to telomere (median 10 per genome)\nand an additional 558 as a single scaffold (median 18 per genome), i.e., in a connected\nsequence containing one or more N-gaps (Figs. 1d,1e; Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary\n**Table 20) (Methods).**\n\nDespite the substantial improvements in assembly quality compared to single-technology\napproaches, certain regions, such as centromeres or the Yq12 region, remained challenging to\n[assemble and evaluate. We, thus, complemented our assembly efforts by running hifiasm (UL)](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/GofTV)\n\non the same dataset (Supplementary Figs. 6,7; Supplementary Tables 21,22; Methods). We\nobserved an overall lower contiguity compared to Verkko and several cases of spurious\nduplications in the hifiasm assemblies (Supplementary Table 23) and, therefore, restricted their\nuse to extending our analysis set for centromeres and the Yq12 region after manual curation of\nthe relevant sequences.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1.

Insertions\nand deletions are imbalanced when called against the GRCh38 reference genome but balanced when called against\nthe T2T-CHM13 reference genome (Fig. 1g). f) Number of SV insertions (left) and deletions (right) called against the\nT2T-CHM13 reference genome, GRCh38 reference genome, or both relative to their allele frequency. SVs called\nagainst both references tend to be more rare because they are less likely to appear in a reference genome. A sharp\npeak for high allele frequency (~1.0) for insertions is detected relative to the GRCh38 reference genome but not the\nT2T-CHM13 reference genome.\n\n#### Variant calling\nFrom our phased assemblies, we identify 188,500 SVs, 6.3 million indels, and 23.9 million\nsingle-nucleotide variants (SNVs) against the T2T-CHM13v2.0 (T2T-CHM13) reference (Fig.\n**1f). Against GRCh38-NoALT (GRCh38), we identify 176,531 SVs, 6.2 million indels, and 23.5**\nmillion SNVs (Supplementary Table 24, Data Availability). Callset construction was performed\n[similarly for both references and was led by PAV (v2.4.0.1)](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy) with orthogonal support from 10\nother independent callers with sensitivity for SVs (eight callers) and indels and SNVs (three\ncallers) (Supplementary Table 25; Methods). We find higher support for PAV calls across all\ncallers (99.7%) compared to other methods (99.7% to 67.9%) (Extended Data Fig. 1d)\n(Supplementary Table 26). With one additional sample, we estimate our callset would increase\nby 842 SV insertions and deletions with a 1.86\u00d7 enrichment for an African versus a non-African\nsample (1,117 vs. 599) (Supplementary Methods).\n\n\n-----\n\n[Compared with our previous resource derived from 32 phased human genome assemblies, our](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy)\ncurrent callset yields 1.6\u00d7 more SV insertions and deletions (177,718 vs. 111,679), which\nincreases to 3.5\u00d7 for SVs greater than 10 kbp (4,541 vs. 1,299) with improvements in assembly\ncontiguity (Supplementary Table 27). Mendelian inheritance error (MIE) has also decreased\n(Supplementary Table 28) with 2.7% MIE for SV insertions and deletions (55% decrease),\n5.1% MIE for inversions, 4.9% MIE for indels (5.5% decrease), and 0.6% MIE for SNVs (79%\ndecrease).\n\nPer assembled haplotype, we identify 7,772 SV insertions and 7,745 SV deletions in the\n[T2T-CHM13 reference (Fig. 1g). As expected, GRCh38 SVs are unbalanced](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ifu62+9fbGN+n1Tgy) with 11,275\nSV insertions and 6,972 SV deletions per haplotype on average (Extended Data Fig. 1e) with\nexcess insertions occurring in high allele-frequency variants, which can be largely explained by\n[reference errors. While GRCh38 yields more SVs per sample compared to T2T-CHM13](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/hb02y)\n(Supplementary Table 29), the T2T-CHM13 callset across all samples contains 6% more SVs,\n2% more indels, and 2% more SNVs highlighting the impact of a more complete T2T reference\n(Supplementary Table 24). We further linked variants across both references through\nassembly coordinates (Supplementary Table 30, Methods). We find the number of fixed\nvariants in the callset is significantly enriched for insertions versus deletions in GRCh38\n(p=7.88\u00d710[-50], Fisher\u2019s exact test [FET]), but not T2T-CHM13 (p=0.40, FET), which holds when\ntandem repeats are excluded (GRCh38 p=6.47\u00d710[-27], T2T-CHM13 p=0.16, FET). Because rare\nalleles are less likely to become reference alleles, SVs identified in both references have lower\nallele frequencies on average (6.5% insertions, 7.8% deletions) compared to variants present in\nonly T2T-CHM13 (8.3% insertions, 11.1% deletions) or GRCh38 (13.3% insertions, 14.7%\ndeletions). As expected, a distinct peak for fixed SVs (100% AF) is apparent for GRCh38 SV\ninsertions composed of variants in GRCh38 with no representation in T2T-CHM13 (Extended\n**Data Fig. 1f). A similar but smaller peak is apparent for GRCh38 deletions (Extended Data Fig.**\n**1f), likely attributable to false duplications in GRCh38.**\n\n## An improved genomic resource\nOur publicly available haplotype-resolved assemblies and the associated SV callset constitute a\nresource for the genomics community that is significantly improved when compared to existing\ngenome resources. Examples of relevant improvements are detailed below.\n\n#### Mobile Element Insertions\n[Mobile element insertions (MEIs) continue to diversify human genomes](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/V60nB) and constitute a\nsignificant portion of SVs (~13% of SVs in this study). To identify MEIs in the 130 haplotype\nassemblies, we generated a union dataset from two independent MEI callsets each for both\nT2T-CHM13 (13,216 putative MEIs) and GRCh38 (13,001 putative MEIs) (Methods). All\nputative MEIs identified by a single caller were manually curated (Methods) (Supplementary\n**Figs. 8,9; Supplementary Tables 31,32). Additionally, our comparison with an orthogonal**\ncallset showed a high average concordance of 90.6% (T2T-CHM13: 90.4%, GRCh38: 90.8%)\n(Methods, Supplementary Tables 33,34). The T2T-CHM13 callset (Alu: 10,689, L1: 1,718,\nSVA: 803, HERV-K: 5, snRNA: 1) and GRCh38 dataset (Alu: 10,522, L1: 1,702, SVA: 770,\nHERV-K: 6, snRNA: 1) had similar MEI compositions. Moreover, we find 569 full-length L1\ninsertions with respect to T2T-CHM13 and 551 with respect to GRCh38. Of these, an average of\n96.4% possess at least one intact open reading frame (ORF) and 82.4% harbor two intact\nORFs. Therefore, the vast majority of full-length L1 MEIs appear to retain the potential to\n\n\n-----\n\n[retrotranspose. Compared to the MEI datasets of the previous HGSVC publication callset](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy)\n\n(n=9,453 MEIs; Alu: 7,738, L1: 1,775, and SVA: 540), the number of MEIs increased by more\nthan 35% (T2T-CHM13: 39.74%; GRCh38: 37.45%). Next, we screened the PAV deletion\ncallsets and identified 2,450 polymorphic MEIs present in T2T-CHM13 and 2,468 MEIs in\nGRCh38 (Supplementary Fig. 10, Supplementary Tables 35,36). Through a combination of\nhigh-quality haplotype-resolved assemblies and more sensitive MEI callers, we are now able to\ninvestigate MEIs in complex regions, resulting in the identification of more MEIs per sample.\n\n#### Inversions\nIdentifying inversions is challenging due to the frequent location of their boundaries in long,\nhighly identical repeat sequences. We identify 276 T2T-CHM13\u2013based and 298 GRCh38-based\ninversions in the main callset. In order to perform validation of the PAV inversion calls,\n[re-genotyping was performed using ArbiGent on Strand-seq data. For T2T-CHM13\u2013based](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/if3Yd)\ninversions, ArbiGent was able to provide an assessment for 252 inversion calls, labeling 218 as\ninversions, 26 as inverted duplications, and 2 as potential misorientations (Supplementary\n**Table 37, Supplementary Methods). To ensure accuracy of these challenging SV calls, we**\n[performed manual inspection (Supplementary Fig. 11)](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UVZFl) to estimate a false discovery rate\n(FDR) of 12.33% (Supplementary Fig. 12). Of the calls passing manual inspection, 97% were\nlabeled as inversions or inverted duplications by ArbiGent (Supplementary Tables 37,38). To\nassess inversion detection sensitivity, we re-genotyped the previously reported T2T-CHM13\u2013\n[and GRCh38-based inversion callsets, which used a subset of 41 samples](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/OYzdp+if3Yd) (Supplementary\n**Tables 39,40). We observed that 179 out of 295 balanced inversions in T2T-CHM13 were**\nidentified by PAV based on requiring a 25% reciprocal overlap. There are only 76 inversions with\nno significant overlap with the current PAV callset, of which 42 are longer than 10 kbp,\ncorresponding to an improved ability to detect inversions directly from assemblies compared to\n[earlier studies. Notably, we find 21 novel inversions in the PAV callset, of which 18 are](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/if3Yd)\ndetected among 24 new samples added in the current study. These include a large (1.8 Mbp)\n[inversion at Chromosome 5q35 that overlaps with the Sotos syndrome critical region.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/8PBR+1lzg)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.

The wild-type allele harbors a single, previously unreported\nisoform consisting of a canonical first exon and second exon that is typically reported as alternate first exon 1b\n(yellow, wild-type). The presence of the 6,142 bp long deletion on chr4:127,125-133,267 is associated with four\n[isoforms not previously annotated in RefSeq, GENCODE, or CHESS](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/RfFqL) (variant, yellow). All four novel isoforms\nbegin at the canonical transcription start site, contain part of exon 1b, and lack canonical exons 2 and 3.\n\n#### Segmental duplication and copy number polymorphic genes\nBecause segmental duplications (SDs) are enriched 10-fold for copy number variation (CNV)\nand are the source of some of the most complex forms of genic structural polymorphism in the\n[human genome, we systematically assessed SD content (>1 kbp and >90% identity) for](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/jVNgk+6ksNp)\neach of the 130 human genomes and then focused on the structure and content of some of the\nmost gene-rich polymorphic regions. Overall, we find an average of 168.1 Mbp (standard\ndeviation [s.d.], 9.2 Mbp) of SDs per human genome. As expected, there is an improved\nrepresentation of interchromosomal SDs (Supplementary Fig. 13) when compared to the\n[Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) release. Both the length and percent](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj)\nidentity distributions for both intrachromosomal and interchromosomal SDs are highly\n\nreproducible with modes at 99.4% (s.d., 0.03%) and 95.0% (s.d., 0.4%) identity, respectively\n(Supplementary Fig. 14). Using T2T-CHM13 as a gauge of completeness, we estimate that\n25.6 Mbp of SDs still remain unresolved per haploid genome (Fig. 2a). Most of these\nunresolved SDs (21.2 Mbp) correspond to the acrocentric short arms of Chromosomes 13, 14,\n15, 21, and 22, which are known to be among the most difficult regions to assemble due to\n[extensive ectopic recombination and the highest degree of sequence homology. Since](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/m0xQz+Eo7oj)\n[high-identity SDs are also a common source of misassembly, we also assessed SDs for](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2eAvI)\nevidence of collapse and confirmed copy number using read depth (Methods). We find that\n80-90% of SDs are accurately assembled depending on the genome (Supplementary Fig. 15).\n\nFocusing on SDs that passed QC (not flagged by NucFreq or Flagger), we observe that African\ngenomes show higher SD content when compared to those of non-African origin\n\n[(Supplementary Fig. 16), confirming a recent report. Next, we performed a pangenome](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/u13vn)\nanalysis using 10 kbp of flanking unique sequence as an anchor to project onto the T2T-CHM13\ngenome (Supplementary Fig. 17, Methods). As a result, we classify at least 92.8 Mbp of the\nSDs as shared among most humans (present in at least 90% of samples) and 61.0 Mbp as\nvariable across the human population (Fig. 2b). In addition, we identify 33 Mbp of SD sequence\npresent in a single copy or not annotated as SDs in T2T-CHM13. (Extended Data Fig. 2). The\nmajority of these (23.6 Mbp, including 2.4 Mbp of chrX SDs) are novel when compared to a\n[recent analysis of 170 human genomes](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/u13vn) and completely or partially overlap with 167\nprotein-coding genes (Supplementary Fig. 18). Predictably, these 33 Mbp represent rare SDs\n\n[19.2 Mbp (n=626) singleton or 3.8 Mbp (n=171) doubleton loci] or variable loci (9.8 Mbp/531\nloci). Notably, 31 loci (0.4 Mbp) are shared among most humans but not classified as duplicated\nin the T2T-CHM13 human genome suggesting that this unique status in the reference\nrepresents the minor allele in the human population, a cell line artifact or, less likely, an error in\nthe assembly. Examining genomes by continental group, the number of new SDs added per\n\n\n-----\n\nsample (diploid) is highest for Africans (3.97 Mbp/individual) when compared to non-African\nsamples (2.88 Mbp/ individual).\n\n[Using GENCODE annotation, we searched specifically for protein-coding genes that are copy](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/cAmN)\nnumber variable and >2 kbp long (Methods). Genomes with African ancestry harbor, on\naverage, 468 additional paralogous genes (n=21,595 total genes) when compared to\n\nnon-African (n=21,127 total genes), consistent with SD data. We identify a total of 727\nmulti-copy genes that have SDs spanning at least 90% of the gene body, with a large proportion\ncorresponding to shared (n=335 or 46.1%) and variable (n=292 or 40.2%) SDs\n\n(Supplementary Table 41). In terms of gene copy number, we observed variation in the\nmajority of these multi-copy genes (n=626 or 86.1%). Comparing the copy numbers to the\n[HPRC assemblies, we discover a similar distribution of genes (Supplementary Fig. 19).](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj)\nAmong copy number polymorphic genes, we identify 16 gene families where the distribution\nsignificantly differs between the HPRC and our data (Supplementary Fig. 19) (adjusted p<0.05,\ntwo-sided Welch\u2019s t-test); however, the contiguity for copy number variant genes was\nconsiderably greater in our assemblies versus HPRC; 5.88% of duplicated genes in our\nassemblies are within 200 kbp of a contig break or unknown base (\u201cN\u201d) compared to 13.95% of\nduplicated genes in HPRC assemblies (Supplementary Fig. 20).\n\n**Extended Data Figure 2. Classification and distribution of changes in SD content in the 65 genomes. a)**\nSchematic depicting the four categories of non-reference SDs: 1) new (i.e., unique in the reference), 2) expanded\ncopy number, 3) content or composition changed, and 4) expanded and content changed SDs with respect to the\nSDs in the reference genome, T2T-CHM13. b) Quantification in terms of Mbp and predicted protein-coding genes\nacross the four categories of new SDs compared to T2T-CHM13. The left panel shows the Mbp by category, while\nflagging those that are singleton (i.e., duplicated in T2T-CHM13 but not in other genomes). The right panel quantifies\n\n\n-----\n\nthe number of complete (100% coverage) and partial overlaps (>50% coverage) with protein-coding genes for the\nrespective chromosomes.\n\n#### Y chromosome variation\nThe Y chromosome remains among the most challenging human chromosomes to fully\n[assemble due to its highly repetitive sequence composition](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/tl1rr+Eo7oj) (Fig. 2c). Our resource provides\nhighly contiguous Y assemblies for 30 male samples. Seven of these (23%) assembled without\nbreaks across the male-specific Y region (excluding the pseudoautosomal regions, six\nassembled as T2T scaffolds, and one has a break in the pseudoautosomal region 1),\n(Supplementary Figs. 21,22). Of these seven, four are novel fully assembled human Y\nchromosomes representing E1b1a, R2a and R1b1a Y lineages prevalent in populations of\n[African, Asian, and European descent. Combined with previous reports, we increase the total](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/dWrcT)\n[number of completely assembled human Y chromosomes to eight (Supplementary Fig. 23).](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4I9rC+meooF)\n\nOur assemblies enable the investigation of the largest heterochromatic region in the human\ngenome, Yq12, mostly composed of highly similar (but size variable) alternating arrays of DYZ1\n(HSat3A6, ~3.5 kbp unit size) and DYZ2 (HSat1B, ~2.4 kbp unit size) repeats (Fig. 2c). The\nYq12 regions across 16 samples (9 novel and 7 previously published) ranged from 17.85\u201337.39\nMbp (mean 27.25 Mbp, median 25.62 Mbp), with high levels of variation in the number (34 to 86\narrays; mean 60, median 58) and length of DYZ1 (24.4 kbp to 3.59 Mbp; mean 525.7 kbp,\nmedian 455.0 kbp) and DYZ2 (11.2 kbp to 2.20 Mbp; mean 358.0 kbp, median 273.3 kbp)\n[repeat arrays (Supplementary Fig. 24, Supplementary Table 42). Investigating the](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4I9rC+meooF)\n[dynamics of Yq12 remains challenging; however, using the duplication and deletion patterns of](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/0AkuP)\nfour unique Alu insertions, we can examine this genomic region over time (Fig. 2c,\n**Supplementary Fig. 24). For example, in NA19239, the presence of retrotransposon insertions**\n(one AluY and five AluYm sequences) allows clear visualization of a tandem duplication in the\nregion.\n\n#### SVs disrupting genes\nTo examine how the SVs in our resource can better identify novel loss-of-function (LoF) variants\nin protein-coding genes, we intersected all 176,531 GRCh38 SVs with coding exons and find\n822 unique genes overlapping with 1,308 unique SVs. The coding sequences of an average of\n181 genes are disrupted by at least one SV breakpoint per genome. Most gene disruptions\nresult from polymorphic variants, with an average of 10 genes disrupted by singleton variants in\neach genome. Of the 822 genes affected by SVs, 18 are annotated as intolerant to LoF in\n[humans as measured by the loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/JLOh0)\n\n<0.35). Seven of these constrained genes are altered by polymorphic SVs (in more than 1 of 65\nsamples). Common SV mutations altering constrained genes suggests that the variants do not\nresult in LoF of the gene. Indeed, we found tandem repeat unit variants in coding sequences of\nfour constrained genes (MUC5B, ACAN, FNM2, ARMCX4). Three additional constrained genes\nhave partially duplicated exons that preserve the coding frame. We also observe deletions of\none or more 59 bp VNTR units that overlap the last 8 bp of exon 37 of MUC5B, but the\n[sequences of codons and splice sites are not altered by these deletions. These examples](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/7egQy)\nillustrate that the previous quantification of mutational constraint from short-read sequencing\nmay be miscalibrated for some genes where simple repeat and SD sequences leave blind spots\nto short reads that are now captured by long reads, which is an area of future consideration for\nmutational intolerance surveys. Among all 1,308 SVs, we find 7 MEIs (6 Alu elements and 1\nSVA). Extending this analysis with an orthogonal approach, we identify 11 additional MEIs (8 Alu\n\n\n-----\n\nelements, 2 SVAs, and 1 L1) that occur in protein-coding exons (Methods). The 18 MEIs\ndisrupted one gene each affecting 56 transcripts (Supplementary Table 43). The insertions\nintroduced a premature stop codon in most transcripts (98.2%). More than half (n=28) of these\nare predicted to evade nonsense-mediated decay (Methods). Most MEIs (72%) represent\nsingleton (n=11) or rare events (allele frequency (AF) 0.01-0.05; n=2), with five being common\n[insertions (AF>0.05). Furthermore, we identify 216 MEIs (188 Alu elements, 15 SVAs, and 13](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/3hxVK)\nL1s) that integrate into the untranslated regions (UTRs) of 216 protein-coding genes impacting\n811 transcripts. Most of these MEIs occur in the 3' UTR (71%) and are mainly (73%) singleton\n(n=101) or rare events (n=60; median: 0.016).\n\n#### Transcriptional effect of SVs\nTo determine the effects of SVs on isoforms, we generated long-read Iso-Seq data for 12 of the\n65 assembly samples (EBV-transformed B-lymphocyte cell lines; Methods). Alignment of\nphased long-read isoforms with haplotype-resolved personal assemblies results in improved\nalignment quality (Fig. 2d), isoform discovery (Extended Data Fig. 3a), and detection of\nimprinted genes (Supplementary text Imprinted Loci). Through intersection of the Iso-Seq\ndata with 176,531 GRCh38 SVs (Methods), we identify a total of 136 structurally variable\nprotein-coding gene sequences with sample-matched Iso-Seq expression data, each involving\nexon-disrupting SVs (Supplementary text Expression Impacted by SVs, Supplementary\n**Table 44). Of these 136 genes, 58% (n=79) contained a common SV (AF>0.05) (Extended**\n**Data Fig. 3b). One example, ZNF718, harbors a common (AF=0.55) 6,142 bp polymorphic**\ndeletion that removes exons 2 and 3 from the canonical transcript as well as the 3' part of an\nexon annotated as an alternate first exon (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The deletion is associated\nwith nine unique isoforms (2 known, 7 previously unreported), five of which are shown in Figure\n**2d. In addition to three known isoforms, we also identify four previously unreported isoforms**\nacross the 14 wild-type haplotypes (Methods). In contrast to other protein-coding genes with a\nsingle SV (Extended Data Fig. 3c), we find a greater transcript diversity among the variant\nhaplotypes of ZNF718 compared to wild-type haplotypes.\n\nBroadening our approach to identify SVs affecting nearby gene expression (RNA-seq), we find\n122 unique SVs proximal (<50 kbp) to 98 differentially expressed genes across the 12 samples,\nrepresenting an enrichment compared with randomly permuted SVs (Extended Data Fig. 3d)\n(empirical p=0.001; Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Fig. 25, Supplementary Table\n**45). Genome-wide, SVs were depleted across protein-coding genes and regulatory regions in**\n[the genome, as expected](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/iAZO) (Extended Data Fig. 3e-f; Supplementary Fig. 26). By intersecting\nthese 122 SVs with Hi-C data from these 12 samples, we find that 29 of the SVs (associated\nwith 24 genes) are potentially associated with contact density changes in chromatin\n\nconformation regions (Extended Data Fig. 3g, Methods, Supplementary Table 46). Finally,\nwe identified 3,818 SVs in high linkage disequilibrium with single-nucleotide polymorphism\n[(SNP) loci uncovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/37M4t) (Supplementary Table 47,\n**Methods), emphasizing biological relevance to human traits and diseases (Extended Data Fig.**\n**3h). Collectively, these results underscore the potential effects of SVs on isoform-level**\ntranscriptomes, gene regulation, chromatin architecture, and disease associations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Extended Data Figure 3.

This has increased the number of SVs detectable from short-read\nWGS to about 18,000 per sample in previous work by the HPRC but was thus far mostly limited\nto common variants due to the relatively small discovery sets used to build the HPRC draft\n[reference. To expand this to variants with lower allele frequency (AF) and gaps in HPRC](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj)\n[assemblies, we constructed a pangenome graph containing all 65 samples assembled here as](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2eAvI)\n[well as 42 HPRC samples](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) [with Minigraph-Cactus](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/XoI9b) (MC) and detected variants by identifying\n[graph bubbles relative to T2T-CHM13](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/XoI9b) [(Methods). We used PanGenie](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/79YCm) to genotype bubbles\n[across all 3,202 samples from the 1kGP cohort based on Illumina data](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/plUNR) and used our\npreviously developed decomposition approach to decompose the 30,490,169 bubbles into\n[28,343,728 SNPs, 10,421,787 indels, and 547,663 SV variant alleles](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) (Supplementary Fig. 27,\n**Methods). Leave-one-out (LOO) experiments confirmed high genotype concordance of up to**\n~94% for biallelic SVs (Supplementary Figs. 28-30) and filtering the resulting genotypes from\n[the 3,202 samples based on a previously developed regression model](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy+zllBj) resulted in a set of\n25,695,951 SNPs, 5,774,201 indels, and 478,587 SVs of reliably genotypable variants\n(Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table 48, Supplementary Figs. 31,32). We note\nthat this SV set is larger than our main PAV callset (188,500 SVs) because it includes the HPRC\nsamples and at the same time retains all SV alleles at multi-allelic sites. We confirm the\nconcordance between the two sets by observing that 392,883 SVs (82%) from the filtered\nPanGenie set have a matched call in the main PAV callset (Supplementary Methods,\n**Supplementary Fig. 33).**\n\nWe compared our genotyped set to other SV sets for the 1kGP samples, including the HPRC\n[PanGenie genotypes we produced previously](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) as well as the 1kGP short-read high-coverage\n[SV callset (1kGP-HC)](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/plUNR) (Supplementary Figs. 34,35). On average, we found 26,115 SVs per\nsample, while this number was 18,462 for the HPRC genotypes and 9,596 for the 1kGP-HC SV\ncalls. We specifically observed increases for rare variants (AF < 1; Fig. 3a). While the average\nnumber of rare SVs per sample was 87 for non-AFR samples in the HPRC set and 169 in the\n1kGP-HC set, we can now access on average 362 rare alleles. For African samples, we\ndetected 1,490 rare SVs per sample, while there were 382 previously for the HPRC and 477 for\nthe 1kGP-HC set.\n\n#### Personal genome reconstruction from an integrated reference panel\nNext, we asked to what extent our improved genotyping abilities allow us to reconstruct the full\nhaplotypic sequences of genomes sequenced with short reads. In order to capture additional\nrare variants not represented in our discovery set and hence not genotyped, we combined our\nfiltered PanGenie genotypes (see Section \u201cGenome-wide genotyping with PanGenie\u201d) with rare\nSNP and indel calls obtained from Illumina reads for all 3,202 1kGP samples (Supplementary\n**[Methods). We phased this combined set using SHAPEIT5](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ncGrG)** to create a reference panel for the\n1kGP set (Supplementary Fig. 27, Step 3). We evaluated the phasing results by comparing to\nour phased assemblies (SNPs, indels, SVs) as well as to a phased Illumina callset for the 1kGP\nsamples (SNPs, indels) (Supplementary Methods) and observed low switch error rates,\n\n\n-----\n\nespecially for samples that are part of trios (0.26%\u20130.18% for child samples, 0.69%\u20130.66% for\nparents, 1.21%\u20131.23% for unrelated samples; Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Fig.\n**36,37).**\n\nWe produced consensus haplotype sequences for all 3,202 samples (6,404 haplotypes) by\nimplanting the phased variants into T2T-CHM13 (only Chromosomes 1-22 and Chromosome X)\nand compared QV estimates and k-mer completeness values to consensus haplotypes\nproduced from the GRCh38-based phased 1kGP-HC panel containing short-read-based SNP,\n[indel and SV calls. While the median QV of the long-read assemblies was 53, we observed a](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/plUNR)\nmedian QV of 45 for the consensus haplotypes computed from our short-read-based phased\ngenotypes (Fig. **3b,** **Supplementary** **Fig. 38). To enable a fair comparison with the**\n\nGRCh38-based 1kGP-HC consensus haplotypes, we additionally computed our QV estimates\nrestricted to regions shared between T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38 (\u201cCHM13-syntenic\u201d). For these\nregions, we observed a median QV of 48, while the QV for the 1kGP-HC set was lower (median\n43; Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 38). Additionally, we computed the k-mer completeness for\nthe consensus haplotypes (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 38). We observed higher k-mer\ncompleteness values (median 97.4%) for the consensus haplotypes produced from our phased\ngenotypes than for the ones produced from the 1kGP-HC phased set (median 97.1%), which is\nconsistent with the use of the more complete reference genome T2T-CHM13. When restricting\nto CHM13-syntenic regions, completeness values between both sets are similar. In summary,\nour analysis shows that the genome inference process from short reads, consisting of PanGenie\ngenotyping followed by phasing, allows us to reconstruct the haplotype sequences to a\nremarkable quality that was previously only achievable from genome assemblies. The 6,404\nconsensus genome sequences are available as a community resource in an AGC-compressed\n[archive.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4zE0E)\n\n#### Targeted genotyping of complex polymorphic loci\nWhile PanGenie performed well in this genome-wide setting, its use of k-mer information could\nmake it difficult to genotype complex, repeat-rich loci with few unique k-mers. We therefore\n[complemented the genome-wide genotyping by using the targeted method Locityper](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/hcz2f) to\ngenotype the 1kGP cohort across 347 polymorphic targets covering 18.2 Mbp and 494\n[protein-coding genes (Methods), including 268 challenging medically relevant genes. As a](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/JNJto)\nreference panel, we used the haplotypes from the MC graph described above. For each\nshort-read sample, Locityper reports a genotype for each locus by picking two of these\nhaplotypes according to a maximum-likelihood approach.\n\nLocityper\u2019s performance is constrained by the haplotypes available in the reference set.\nTherefore, we first evaluated haplotype availability by comparing sequences of the unrelated\nassembled haplotypes. Across all target loci, 51.5% of our assembled haplotypes were very\nsimilar (QV \u226540) to some other haplotype from the full reference panel, compared to only 39.6%\n[of haplotypes when restricting to an HPRC-only reference panel](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the\nnumber of almost-complete loci (average QV availability \u226540) increased almost twofold, from 95\nloci for the HPRC-only panel to 167 loci for the full panel.\n\nThe increased haplotype availability translates into improved genotyping of polymorphic loci and\nwe observe 80.0% haplotypes to be predicted with QV \u226530 using a LOO experiment compared\nto 74.6% haplotypes for the HPRC-only panel (Methods). When requiring QV \u226540, we still\nrecover 42.6% of all haplotypes at this quality, compared to 33.7% for the HPRC-only panel\n\n\n-----\n\n(Methods). These global improvements are mirrored by improvements of individual genes, with\nthe top 10 genes in terms of average increase in QV shown in Figure 3e, including HLA-DRB5,\n_HLA-DPA1, and HLA-B (Extended Data Fig. 5). To produce a resource across these_\nchallenging loci for the community, we ran Locityper on all 3,202 samples from the 1kGP cohort.\nThe reliability of the genotypes in the LOO experiments above is further corroborated by high\nMendelian consistency observed across the 602 trios, with an average concordance QV of 42.6.\nLastly, we asked what performance could potentially be achieved with Locityper for growing\nreference panels, where virtually all relevant haplotypes are available. To answer this, we\ncompare the genotypes obtained for our samples when genotyping using the full reference\npanel to the respective assembly haplotypes. Here, Locityper predicts highly accurate\nhaplotypes, with average QV of 45.8 and only 1.6% of the haplotypes with QV < 20, suggesting\nthat sequence resolution of more reference haplotypes will aid future re-genotyping of\nchallenging medically relevant genes, with applications to disease cohorts.\n\n**Figure 3.

To allow comparison between the GRCh38and T2T-CHM13-based sets, we additionally restricted our QV analysis to \u201csyntenic\u201d regions of\n\n\n-----\n\nT2T-CHM13, i.e., excluding regions unique to T2T-CHM13. The red dotted line corresponds to the\nbaseline QV that we estimated by randomizing sample labels (i.e., using PanGenie-based consensus\nhaplotypes and reads from different samples). The median is marked in yellow and the lower and upper\nlimits of each box represent lower and upper quartiles (Q1 and Q3). Lower and upper whiskers are\ndefined as Q1 \u2212 1.5(Q3\u2013Q1) and Q3 + 1.5(Q3\u2013Q1), and dots mark the outliers. c) Completeness statistics\nfor haplotypes produced from the 1kGP-HC phased set (GRCh38-based) and the HGSVC phased\ngenotypes (T2T-CHM13\u2013based). To allow for comparison between the GRCh38- and T2T-CHM13-based\ncallsets, we additionally restricted our analysis to \u201csyntenic\u201d regions of T2T-CHM13, i.e., excluding regions\nunique to T2T-CHM13. For both phased sets, completeness was computed on a subset of 30 samples. d)\nHaplotype availability, Locityper genotyping accuracy, and trio concordance across 347 polymorphic loci.\nAvailability and accuracy are calculated for 61 HGSVC samples, while trio concordance is calculated for\n602 trios. Results are grouped by the reference panel [HPRC-only, HPRC + HGSVC leave-one-out\n(LOO), and HPRC + HGSVC]. e) Locityper genotyping accuracy for 10 target loci with the highest\naverage QV improvement.\n\n## Major Histocompatibility Complex\n\n[Given the complexity of the 5 Mbp MHC region (Fig. 4a) and its relevance to disease, we](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/fyVED+BdTeo+MxDjR)\nperformed a more systematic analysis of the 130 complete or near-complete MHC haplotypes.\nPer haplotype we annotate 27-33 HLA genes (human leukocyte antigen) and 140-146 non-HLA\ngenes/pseudogenes along with the associated repeat content (Supplementary Table 49). We\nfound that 99.2% (357/360) of the HLA alleles agree with classical typing [results](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zojB0)\n\n(Supplementary Tables 50,51). We identify and submit a total of 826 previously incomplete\n[HLA allele annotations to the IPD-IMGT/HLA reference database](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/TvkfI) (Supplementary Table 52).\nThis includes 112 sequences from the HLA-DRB locus, important for vaccine response and\n[autoimmune disease. We observe a previously unknown copy number variant, a deletion of](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2lYFr+AbVf)\n_HLA-DPA2 on one haplotype (HG03807.1), as well as low-frequency gene-level SVs, such as a_\n[deletion of MICA on one haplotype. We identify 170 SVs not present in previously available](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CHXac)\n[reference haplotypes](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Y7d7X+EpWge) (Supplementary Table 53); the majority of these (64%) are enriched\nin repeats (\u226570%); 30 of the remaining ones are >1 kbp.\n\nOverall, MHC class II haplotypes are compatible with the established DR group system (Fig. 4b,\n**Supplementary Table 54) and comprise representatives of DR5, DR8 and DR9, which were not**\n[previously analyzed in detail. Repeat element analyses (Supplementary Figs. 39-41;](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Y7d7X+EpWge)\n**Methods) suggest that an intrachromosomal deletion mediated by 150 bp of sequence**\nhomology between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB3 on the DR3/5/6 haplotype gave rise to DR8\npotentially as a result of homology-mediated double-strand breakage (Fig. 4c). Similarly, we find\nthat DR1 is most likely derived from a recombination event occurring between DR2 and DR4/7/9\n(Fig. 4c) with a LINE/L1 repeat defining the breakpoints (Supplementary Figs. 39,42). Finally,\n[we also create a more comprehensive catalog of solitary HLA-DRB exon sequences. This](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/BWMkd+0MiAm)\nincludes refining copy number estimates (e.g., observing a copy number of 3 instead of 1 for\nsolitary HLA-DRB exon 1 sequences in the HLA-DRB9 region of DR1) as well as identifying a\npreviously uncharacterized solitary exon location 10 kbp 3' of HLA-DRB1 present on some\nhaplotypes (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Methods).\n\nSimilarly, we characterize the RCCX multi-allelic cluster where tandem duplications or modules\nof variable copy number are each composed of four genes: serine/threonine kinase 19\n(RP1/STK19), complement component 4 (C4), steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21), and tenascin-X\n[(TNX). Each module typically encodes one functional variant of C4 (C4AS, C4AL, C4BS, or](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/cXqQd+zej1U+JmXx3)\n\n\n-----\n\n_C4BL) and three additional functional genes (STK19, CYP21A2, and TNXB) or pseudogenes_\n(STK19B, CYP21A1P, and TNXA) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 43, Supplementary Table\n**55); however, phasing and variant classification has been challenging due to extensive**\n[sequence homology. Tandem duplications (aka RCCX bi-modules) are the most abundant](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/JmXx3+yc0T3)\namong our assembly haplotypes (74.6% or n=97) with mono-modules and tri-modules\ncomparable in frequency (13.1% (n=17) and 12.3% (n=16), respectively (Supplementary Fig.\n**43). The complete haplotype sequence also facilitates the detection of interlocus gene**\n[conversion events critical for RCCX evolution. For example, we identify two haplotypes](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n4XlS+VLvlb+HMDAl)\nhaving a tri-modular RCCX with two functional CYP21A2 copies, likely the result of interlocus\ngene conversion; one mono-modular and one bi-modular haplotype with no functional CYP21A2\ngenes; and one tri-modular haplotype with a unique configuration where C4B precedes C4A and\ncarries two copies of CYP21A2, one of which was nonfunctional (Fig. 4d). We suggest that the\nlatter haplotype was generated by the introduction of one nonsense mutation and two gene\nconversion events, converting CYP21A1P into CYP21A2 and C4A into a C4B that now\nunusually encodes the Rodgers (Rg) blood group epitope. We also identify seven novel C4\namino acid variants, four residing within the beta-chain (283R->C, 530S->L, 566A->G,\n614K->Q) and three within the gamma-chain (1477K->N, 1722R->C, 1724R->W)\n\n(Supplementary Figs. 44,45).\n\nFinally, we tested whether the established class II DR group nomenclature could be\nrecapitulated using unbiased, sequence-based analysis. To this end, we applied a pangenomic\n[multiscale analysis method, PGR-TK](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/xnj5m) (Fig. 4e), to a subset of our genomes (n=55) as well as\n[T2T-CHM13. We identify 63 conserved blocks in 111 haplotypes (55 diploid genomes](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/m0xQz)\ncorresponding to 110 haplotypes plus the haploid T2T-CHM13) greater than 6 kbp. Multiscale\nhierarchical clustering of the haplotypes perfectly reconstitutes the traditional DR group system\nin the region around HLA-DRB1 (Fig. 4e). However, we also observe additional diversified\nsubgroups that could serve as the basis for a more fine-grained future classification of HLA-DR\nhaplotypes or be used in the context of GWAS, especially when coupled with the improved\nability for targeted genotyping (Extended Data Fig. 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4.

Locityper genotyping accuracy across 33 genes/pseudogenes, located at**\n**the MHC locus. Genotyping was performed for 61 Illumina short-read HGSVC datasets using three**\nreference panels: HPRC (90 haplotypes), leave-one-out HPRC + HGSVC (LOO, 214 haplotypes), and\nHPRC + HGSVC (full, 216 haplotypes). Accuracy is evaluated as the number of correctly identified allele\nfields in the corresponding gene nomenclature.\n\n## Complex structural polymorphisms\n\nLong-read assembled genomes significantly enhance the detection and characterization of\ncomplex structural variants (CSVs) defined here as SVs with more than two breakpoints.\nBecause CSV breakpoints are often located in repetitive sequences, including SDs and\n[MEIs, we recently updated PAV](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/0uJqh+CH5uq+gyG5c+RVLWU) to identify CSVs embedded in large complex repeats like\nSDs (Methods). Using this method, we find on average 55 complex SVs per sample (range 37\nto 85) with median SV sizes ranging from 47 kbp to 222 kbp (Supplementary Table 56, Data\n**Availability). Across all samples, we identify 1,909 complex SVs with 200 distinct complex**\nreference signatures composed of deletions (n=1,498), duplications (n=440), inversions\n\n(n=196), inverted duplications (n=207), and higher-copy elements (n=142). Because many\nCSVs contain distal sequences, many leave alignments that mimic simple deletions (n=1,107;\n60%) and duplications (n=152; 8.2%), which can mislead downstream SV calling tools. To\naddress this, PAV links these distal and unaligned segments with the CSV to resolve its\nstructure. As an example, we highlight two CSVs involving NOTCH2NL and NBPF, genes\n[implicated in expansion of the human brain, as well as a core duplicon associated with genomic](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy)\n[instability. While the full structures could not be resolved by previous optical mapping or](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/r2dMR)\nsequencing experiments, we can now distinguish four distinct haplotype structures, including a\nreference haplotype (AF 0.15), a simple inversion around NBPF8 (AF 0.02), a 986 kbp CSV with\na distal template switch replacing NBPF8 with NBPF9 (AF 0.51), and an 851 kbp CSV\n(DEL-INV-DEL) inverting NBPF8 and deleting NOTCH2NLR and NBPF26 (AF 0.33) (Fig. 5a).\n\n\n-----\n\nCloser examination of the DEL-INV-DEL CSV suggests there may be two similar CSV events\nwith sizes 986 kbp (AF 0.18) and 848 kbp (AF 0.15). By combining contiguous assemblies with\nimproved methods, we can now detect complex structures that other methods cannot. For\nexample, no other SV callers we ran detected the complex NBPF8 structures or their associated\ndeletions.\n\nAs a second example, we focus on a biomedically relevant and structurally complex region\ncontaining SMN1 and SMN2 gene copies. Deletion or disruption of SMN1 is associated with\nspinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and its paralogue, SMN2, is the target of one of the most\n[successful ASO-mediated gene therapies. The genes are embedded in a very large SD](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zjp9C+8YbIY)\nregion (~1.5 Mbp) that has been almost impossible to fully sequence resolve despite the\n[advances of the last two decades](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/sYSMW+2eAvI+zllBj+n1Tgy) (Supplementary Fig. 46), including in the recent HPRC\n[pangenome release. We successfully assembled, validated, and characterized two thirds of all](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj+2eAvI)\npossible haplotypes (n=101) fully resolving the structure and copy number (full or partial gene\nalignments) of SMN1/2, SERF1A/B, NAIP, and GTF2H2/C. We find that about half (n=48) of all\nhaplotypes carry exactly two copies of SMN1/2, SERF1A/B, and GTF2H2/C while NAIP is\npresent mostly in a single copy. We highlight 11 human haplotypes that show increasing\ncomplexity in duplicon structure and palindromic structures (Fig. 5b-d). We specifically\ndistinguish functional SMN1 and SMN2 copies based on our assemblies (Supplementary Fig.\n**47)** and compare them with short-read based genotyping methods [Parascopy](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/OsWQ6) and\n\n[SMNCopyNumberCaller. For samples where both haplotypes are fully assembled (n=31),](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/C5Te5)\npredicted SMN1/2 copy numbers match perfectly among the three methods (Supplementary\n**Fig. 48). Our analysis shows that 98 haplotypes carry the ancestral SMN1 copy but three do not**\nand are potentially disease-risk loci that may have arisen as a result of interlocus gene\nconversion (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 49).\n\nFinally, we analyzed the structure of the amylase locus spanning 212.5 kbp on Chromosome 1\n(GRCh38; chr1:103,554,220\u2013103,766,732) and containing the AMY2B, AMY2A, AMY1A,\n_[AMY1B, and AMY1C genes](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/gKyf)_ (Fig. 5f). From 130 sequence-resolved genomes, we identify 35\ndistinct amylase haplotypes (Supplementary Fig. 50, Supplementary Table 57) supported by\nboth Verkko and optical genome mapping de novo assemblies, representing the largest number\nof base-pair resolution amylase haplotypes described to date. The length of these amylase\nhaplotypes ranges from 111 kbp (H1[a].1 and H1[a].2) to 582 kbp (H11.1) (Fig. 5f), including those\nthat are structurally identical to the GRCh38 (H3[r].1) and T2T-CHM13 (H7.3) assemblies. Among\nthe identified haplotypes, four are common: H1[a].1 (n=14), H3[r].1 (n=13), H3[r].2 (n=19), and H3[r].4\n(n=22) (constituting 57% of all genomes), while 23 are singletons. We identify nine haplotypes\npreviously supported only by optical genome mapping data and fully sequence-resolve the\n[largest novel haplotype to date (H11.1; 11 AMY1 [8.8 kbp] copies)](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/gW3Sw+FC3Hc+Gh377) (Fig. 5f).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5. Complex SVs in human populations. a) An SD-mediated CSV inverts NBPF8 and deletes**\ntwo genes. Inverted SD pairs (orange and yellow bands) each mediate a template switch (dashed lines\n\u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d). The resulting CSV inverts NBPF8 and deletes NOTCH2NLR and NBPF26. The single\nrecombined copy of each SD is aligned to both reference copies, obscuring the structure of the complex\nevent by eliminating one deletion and changing the size of the inversion and the larger deletion. PAV\nrecognizes these artifacts and refines alignments to obtain a more accurate representation of complex\nstructures.

Haplotypes that carry only the\n_SMN2 gene copy are highlighted by the asterisks. f) The amylase locus of the human genome is_\ndepicted. The H3r.4 haplotype represents the most common haplotype, H5.15 and H7.2 are haplotypes\npreviously unresolved at the base-pair level, and H11.1 is a novel, previously undetected haplotype.\nAmylase gene annotations are displayed above each haplotype structure. The structure of each amylase\nhaplotype, composed of amylase segments, is indicated by colored arrows. Sequence similarity between\nhaplotypes ranges from 99% to 100%. The alignments highlight differences between the amylase\nhaplotypes.\n\n## Centromeres\n\nAmong the most mutable regions in the human genome are the centromeres, which are large\n[chromosomal domains that are typically composed of tandemly repeating \u03b1-satellite DNA. In](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/eZybW)\nhumans, centromeric \u03b1-satellite DNA is organized into higher-order repeats (HORs), which are\n[assembled into arrays that can span up to several megabases on each chromosome. The](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Xhpe1+zoClm+B8gWT)\nrepetitive nature of the centromeres means that they are prone to homologous recombination\nand other mutational processes that lead to duplications, deletions, and mutations of \u03b1-satellite\nHORs, resulting in expansions and contractions of the centromeric \u03b1-satellite HOR array. A\nprevious study comparing two complete sets of human centromeres revealed that approximately\n[22% of centromeres vary by over 1.5-fold in length, and ~30% of them vary in their structure.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/kEO2V)\nHere, we expand our understanding of centromere diversity by assessing the genetic and\nepigenetic variation of the centromeres from 65 diverse human genomes.\n\nWe first assessed the contiguity and accuracy of each centromere by aligning Verkko and\nhifiasm assemblies to the T2T-CHM13 reference genome and identifying contigs that traversed\nthe centromeres from the p- to the q-arm. Then, we assessed the accuracy of the centromeric\n[assemblies using two computational tools, Flagger](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) [and NucFreq, to identify those that lacked](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Tx6pb)\nlarge structural errors. Ultimately, we identified 822 centromeres from the Verkko assemblies\nand 777 centromeres from the hifiasm assemblies that were completely and accurately\nassembled. We found that approximately 28.3% of all centromeres were correctly assembled by\nboth assemblers, while 37.7% were correctly assembled by only Verkko, and 34.1% were\ncorrectly assembled by only hifiasm. We combined these two datasets into a nonredundant set\nof 1,246 completely and accurately assembled centromeres (~52 centromeres per\n\nchromosome, on average, and ~19.5 centromeres per genome, on average; Extended Data\n**Fig. 5a, Supplementary Tables 58,59). We used this dataset, which is 621 (twofold) more**\n[centromeres than those previously analyzed, to assess the genetic and epigenetic](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/kEO2V+eZybW+r0L0T+6ma45)\nvariation across 65 diverse genomes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6. Variation in the sequence, structure, and methylation pattern among 1,246 human centromeres.**\n**a) Length of the \u0251-satellite higher-order repeat (HOR) array(s) for each complete and accurately assembled**\ncentromere from each genome. Each data point indicates an active \u0251-satellite HOR array and is colored by\npopulation. The median length of all \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays is shown as a dashed line. For each chromosome, the\nmedian (solid line) and first and third quartiles (dashed lines) are shown. b) Sequence, structure, and methylation\nmap of centromeres from the CHM13, CHM1, and a subset of 65 diverse human genomes. The \u03b1-satellite HORs are\ncolored by the number of \u03b1-satellite monomers within them, and the site of the putative kinetochore, known as the\n\u201ccentromere dip region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d, is shown. c) Differences in the \u0251-satellite HOR array organization and methylation\npatterns between the CHM13 and HG00513 (H1) chromosome 10 centromeres. The CDRs are located on highly\nidentical sequences in both centromeres, despite their differing locations. d) Mobile element insertions (MEIs) in the\n\n\n-----\n\nchromosome 2 centromeric \u03b1-satellite HOR array. Most MEIs are consistent with duplications of the same element\nrather than distinct insertions, and all of them reside outside of the CDR.\n\nWe first measured the variation in the length of the centromeric \u03b1-satellite HOR array(s) on each\nchromosome (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Table 59). We found that, on average, centromeric\n\u03b1-satellite HOR arrays are 2.31 Mbp in length; however, there are clear outliers. For example,\nthe \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays from Chromosomes 3, 4, 10, 13-16, 21, and Y are consistently\nsmaller than average, with a mean length of 1.2, 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 2.0, 1.5, 1.8, 1.3, and 0.7 Mbp,\nrespectively. In contrast, the \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays on Chromosomes 1, 11, and 18 are much\nlarger than average, with a mean length of 4.0, 3.5, and 3.9 Mbp, respectively. The greatest\nvariation in length occurs on Chromosome 10, which has a 37.5-fold difference in length\nbetween the smallest and largest \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays; however, the greatest absolute\ndifference in length occurs on Chromosome 18, wherein the smallest and largest \u03b1-satellite\nHOR arrays differ by 5.9 Mbp.\n\nWe compared the sequence and structure of all 1,246 centromeres and identified 4,153 new\n\u03b1-satellite HOR variants and novel array organizations among the active \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays\n(Fig. 6b). On Chromosome 1, for example, we found evidence of an insertion of monomeric\n\u03b1-satellite sequences into the D1Z7 \u03b1-satellite HOR array, which had split the \u03b1-satellite HOR\narray into two distinct arrays (Fig. 6b). A similar bifurcation event also occurred on the\nChromosome 12 and 19 centromeres, generating two \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays where there\ntypically is only one (Fig. 6b,c). Additionally, we found novel \u03b1-satellite HOR array organizations\nfor Chromosomes 6 and 10 that differ from the CHM1 and CHM13 arrays on those\n[chromosomes](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/kEO2V) (Fig. 6b). These array organizations, which are the most common in our\ndataset, are primarily composed of either 6-monomer \u03b1-satellite HORs (Chromosome 6) or 6and 8-monomer \u03b1-satellite HORs (Chromosome 8). Finally, we found evidence of a relic\n\u03b1-satellite HOR variant on some centromeres, such as on Chromosome 15, where an ancestral\n11-monomer \u03b1-satellite HOR variant was present in high abundance on some haplotypes but\nhad since been substantially reduced in abundance in the CHM13 and CHM1 centromeres (Fig.\n**6b).**\n\nTo determine how variation in centromeric sequence and structure affects their epigenetic\nlandscape, we assessed the CpG methylation pattern along each centromere using native ONT\ndata. We found that all centromeres contain at least one region of hypomethylation (termed the\n[\u201ccentromere dip region\u201d or CDR) that is thought to mark the site of the kinetochore. However,](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/eZybW+8yv9w)\nin many cases, such as on Chromosomes 6, 15, and 19, there were at least two CDRs >80 kbp\napart (Fig. 6b, Extended Data Fig. 5b-d). This suggests the presence of a \u201cdi-kinetochore\u201d,\nwhich may form a dicentric chromosome on ~7% of chromosomes, but additional analyses that\nassess the location of the centromeric histone H3 variant, CENP-A, will need to be performed to\nconfirm these putative kinetochore sites. To determine whether the CDR associates with\nrecently evolved and actively homogenizing \u03b1-satellite HORs, we generated sequence identity\n[heatmaps](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4N79W) of each centromere and found that, indeed, the CDR often resides within the most\nhighly identical regions of the \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays (Fig. 6c, Extended Data Fig. 5d). Even\nwhen the \u03b1-satellite HOR array is split into two arrays, such as on Chromosome 19, the CDR\nassociates with the array containing some of the most highly identical \u03b1-satellite HORs\n(Extended Data Fig. 5d). This suggests that the kinetochore may track with actively\nhomogenizing \u03b1-satellite HOR sequences in response to a coevolution between centromeric\n[DNA and proteins. Additional analyses that test this centromere coevolution theory will need to](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/0pHH)\nbe performed to confirm its validity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Extended Data Figure 5.

Most MEIs are consistent with duplications\nof the same element rather than distinct insertions, and all of them reside outside of the CDR.\n\nIn addition to variation in sequence and structure, we also noted the presence of MEIs in many\nof the \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays (Methods). We found that ~30% of all active \u03b1-satellite HOR\narrays contained at least one MEI (Methods). In total, we identified 89 unique polymorphic\ninsertions with varying allele frequencies (Supplementary Table 60). L1 insertions were the\nmost prevalent centromeric MEI, with 58% of all unique MEIs occurring from L1s, 41% occurring\nfrom Alu elements, and 1% from SVAs. One \u03b1-satellite HOR array that was highly enriched with\nMEIs was the D2Z1 \u03b1-satellite HOR array on Chromosome 2 (Fig. 6d). This array had at least\none L1HS and/or Alu insertion in 80% of haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 5e). L1HS\ninsertions/duplications were the most common, occurring on average three times per array, and\nthree unique Alu insertions, two of which belonged to the AluYb8 subfamily and one AluYa5,\nwere present in low allele frequency on the D2Z1 \u03b1-satellite HOR array. Nearly all insertions, as\nwell as their duplications, were located outside of the CDRs and typically towards the periphery.\nHowever, one AluYb8 insertion (in NA20509 haplotype 1) was located between two CDRs and\nappeared to \u2018break\u2019 a single CDR into two, while a pair of L1HSs were found on either side of a\nCDR in two haplotypes (NA19331 H1 and NA19650 H1), where they may act as boundaries to\n[restricting the movement of the CDR and CENP-A chromatin, as suggested previously.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/EdzNS+IdDwS)\n\n# Discussion\n\nLong-read sequencing and assembly have enabled both the full resolution of a human genome\n[sequence](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/m0xQz) [and fundamentally deepened our understanding of human genetic diversity.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ifu62+9fbGN+n1Tgy+zllBj)\n[The development of a human pangenome reference](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj+qaZUH) should ideally be based on completely\nphased and assembled diverse genomes, with as few gaps and switch errors as technically\n[possible. While there are plans to achieve this for hundreds of human genomes, practically,](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/5J3Kn)\nfew true T2T genomes have been generated and, thus, the pangenome is still a\n\nwork-in-progress. Nevertheless, algorithms and technology have advanced significantly in the\nlast two years, and we demonstrate that >99% of the human genome can be accurately phased\nand assembled by focusing on 65 diverse samples (130 human genomes). We characterize\n[regions previously excluded or collapsed](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2eAvI+zllBj) including centromeres, biomedically complex regions\nsuch as SMN1/SMN2, and thousands of more complex SV patterns. While acrocentric regions\nremain to be finished, we show that it is possible to fully resolve almost all variation in the\ngenome providing new biological insights and enhancing the potential for future disease\nassociation.\n\nAs an example, we characterize one of the largest sets of complete MHC haplotypes assembled\nto date and show the value of this deeper pangenome representation for improved genotyping.\nOur detailed annotation confirms the high accuracy of our assemblies, defines precise\nbreakpoints of rearrangement within and between haplotypes, provides a more complete\ncharacterization of genes and pseudogenes, and allows us to construct the first pangenome\n[haplotype graph. Using these data, we apply Locityper](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/hcz2f) to genotype from short-read data\nacross 19 protein-coding genes and 14 pseudogenes from the MHC locus and compare\n\n\n-----\n\npredicted gene alleles against assembly-based gene annotation. Across all 33 loci, Locityper\ncorrectly predicts gene alleles in 81.0% cases when restricting to a limited HPRC-only reference\n[panel (45 samples). Adding our assemblies to the reference panel (n=107 samples or 214](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj)\nphased genomes) increases accuracy to 86.3% (leave-one-out experiment) and 97.1% of the\ncases (full panel where all 214 phased genomes are leveraged). These differences highlight the\nsignificant gain in genotyping accuracy achieved by mapping short-read data to a more diverse\nhuman pangenome.\n\nThese observations for targeted genotyping are mirrored in a genome-wide setting, where this\ncombined panel led to considerably improved genome inference. That is, given this combined\nresource, we are able to reconstruct a genome from short reads to a QV of up to 48,\ncorresponding to an average base error of about 0.00158%. This process detects 26,115 SVs\nper sample on average from short-read sequence data and notably now recovers more rare\nSVs (AF<1%) than direct variant discovery from short reads. We want to emphasize, however,\nthat these improvements are likely due to a combination of different factors, including\nimprovements in assembly quality, the larger number of panel samples, improved versions of\n[the Minigraph-Cactus](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/XoI9b) [and PanGenie](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/79YCm) softwares, and the switch to the more complete\nT2T-CHM13 reference genome. While it is difficult to precisely delineate the influence of all\nthese individual factors, it appears likely that genotyping accuracy will improve even more as the\nHPRC, for example, increases the number of genomes to several hundreds and pushes those\n[genomes to a T2T state. This, in turn, will make disease-association studies from short reads](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/5J3Kn)\nconsiderably more powerful for complex variation.\n\nThe use of both ultra-long ONT and PacBio HiFi sequencing data generated from the same\nsamples was critical to accessing previously unresolved regions of the genome. For example,\nwe fully assembled 1,246 centromeres\u201442% of all possible centromeres in these\n\nsamples\u2014representing the deepest survey of completed human centromeres to date. The\nanalysis provided both technical and biological insights. As expected, we observed considerable\nvariation in the content and length of the \u03b1-satellite HOR array (up to 37-fold for Chromosome\n[10) consistent with its higher mutation rate and more rapid evolutionary turnover. We also,](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/kEO2V+2eAvI)\nhowever, document recent Alu, LINE-1, and SVA retrotransposition into the \u03b1-satellite HORs\nand show that these may be used to tag HOR expansions on particular human haplotypes.\n[Using the CDR](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/eZybW+8yv9w) as a marker of kinetochore attachment, we show considerable variation in\nthe location across human centromeres and remarkably that 7% of human chromosomes show\nevidence of two or more putative kinetochores (i.e., di-kinetochores). The significance of both\nMEIs and di-kinetochore on chromosome segregation or mis-segregation will need to be\nexperimentally assessed and these phased genomes (and their corresponding cell lines)\nprovide the foundation for such future work.\n\nFinally, from a technical perspective, it should be noted that using two independent assembly\nalgorithms, hifiasm (UL) and Verkko, nearly doubled the number of sequence-resolved\ncentromeres. While the two methods were strongly complementary for centromeres, Verkko was\nclearly superior for Chromosome Y (Supplementary Fig. 22c). Therefore, the assembly\nperformance differs by sequence class and, at present, there is benefit in applying both\nassembly algorithms in order to fully resolve the most structurally complex regions of the\ngenome. While the performance of both Verrko and hifiasm has been shown to be very similar\n[for large portions of the euchromatin, it is likely that similar analyses of problematic/challenging](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/GofTV)\n\n\n-----\n\nregions will benefit from applying both assembly algorithms. More method development is\nwarranted to devise an assembly tool combining the strengths of both methods.\n\n# Methods\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data produced by the HGSVC and analyzed as part of this study are available under the\nfollowing accessions (see Supplementary Tables 2-4,6,7 for details): PacBio HiFi and ONT\nlong reads: PRJEB58376, PRJEB75216, PRJEB77558, PRJEB75190, PRJNA698480,\n\nRJEB75739, PRJEB36100, PRJNA988114, PRJNA339722, PRJEB41778, ERP159775;\n\nStrand-seq: PRJEB39750, PRJEB12849; Bionano Genomics: PRJNA339722, PRJEB41077,\nPRJEB58376, PRJEB77842; Hi-C: PRJEB39684, PRJEB75193, PRJEB58376; PacBio Iso-Seq:\nPRJEB75191; RNA-seq: PRJEB75192, PRJEB58376.

The majority (63/65) of the samples\n[originate from the 1kGP Diversity Panel, one (NA21487) from the International HapMap](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/eCV2j)\n[Project, and one (NA24385, also called HG002) commonly used for benchmarking by the](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ycIwl)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) consortium](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/cZjT1) was included in all analyses with publicly available data\nfrom other efforts (Supplementary Tables 1-4,6,7). Samples were selected to maximize genetic\ndiversity and Y-chromosome lineages (Supplementary Methods).\n\n## Data production\n\n[In addition to data generated through previous efforts, sequencing libraries were prepared](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy+4I9rC)\nfrom high-molecular-weight DNA or RNA extracted from lymphoblast lines (Coriell Institute).\nPacBio HiFi sequencing data were generated on the Sequel II or Revio platforms using 30-hr\nmovie times. ONT ultra-long libraries were generated using a modified fragmentase protocol\nand sequenced on R9.4.1 flow cells on a PromethION instrument for 96 hrs. Bionano Genomics\noptical mapping data using DLE-1 tagging were collected on Saphyr 2nd generation\n\ninstruments. Strand-seq data were produced using BrdU incorporation and second-strand DNA\nremoval during PCR-based library construction to generate single-nucleus barcoded libraries\n[sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Hi-C data were collected using Proximo](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/hCa5+auSM)\nHi-C kits v4.0 (Phase Genomics) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. RNA-seq\nlibraries were generated using KAPA RNA Hyperprep with RiboErase (Roche) and sequenced\non an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Iso-Seq full-length cDNA libraries were created with the\nIso-Seq Express protocol and sequenced on a PacBio Sequel II system. Detailed descriptions\nof materials and methods are available (Supplementary Methods).\n\n## Assembly\n\n[We produced fully phased hybrid assemblies using Verkko](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/kRuB4) (v1.4.1) as our primary assembler.\nFor some of the most challenging regions (centromeres and Yq12), we additionally created\n[hifiasm (UL)](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/GofTV) (v0.19.6) assemblies that were manually evaluated in those regions. The phasing\n[signal for all assemblies was generated using the Graphasing pipeline](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/DeVEa) (v0.3.1-alpha). All\nassemblies were scanned for contamination with NCBI\u2019s Foreign Contamination Screening\n[workflow](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/P4gx) [(v0.4.0) and annotated for potential assembly errors using Flagger](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) (v0.3.3),\n[Merqury](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/psxCr) [(v1.0), NucFreq](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Tx6pb) [(commit #bd080aa), and Inspector](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/h32mJ) (v1.2). Assembly quality was\n[assessed by computing QV estimates with Merqury and DeepVariant](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/TvIl) (v1.6) as described\n[previously. Gene completeness of the assemblies was evaluated using compleasm](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy) (v0.2.5)\n[and the primate set of known single-copy genes of OrthoDB](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/00e5) (v10). The T2T status of the\n[assembled chromosomes and the closing status of previously reported gaps](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/2eAvI) was determined\n[relative to T2T-CHM13 reference genome](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/m0xQz) by factoring in the above QC information in the\n[evaluation of the contig-to-reference alignment produced with minimap2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CGKK+af9h) (v2.26) and\n[mashmap](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/l8hw) (v3.1.3). The parental support for the assembled child haplotypes in the three\nfamily trios was computed by evaluating the CIGAR operations in the minimap2 contig-to-contig\nalignments between the parents and child.\n\n## Variant calling\n\n_Genome_ _reference._ Callsets were constructed against two references, GRCh38\n\n[(GRCh38-NoALT) and T2T-CHM13 (T2T-CHM13v2.0).](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/m0xQz)\n\n_[Variant discovery and merging. For assembly-based callsets, we ran PAV](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy)_ (v2.4.1) with\n[minimap2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CGKK) [(v2.26) and LRA](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/DEVq) [(v1.3.7.2) alignments, DipCall](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/U7K4) [(v0.3), and SVIM-asm](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/AUoH)\n\n\n-----\n\n(v1.0.3). SVIM-asm used PAV alignments before PAV applied any alignment trimming, and\nDipCall produced minimap2 alignments for DipCall variants.\n\nFor PacBio HiFi callsets, we ran PBSV (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbsv; v2.9.0),\n[Sniffles](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/88SN) [(v2.0.7), Delly](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/sYms) [(v1.1.6), cuteSV](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/LSCv) [(v2.0.3), DeBreak](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/8IML) [(v1.0.2), SVIM](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/s3uz) (v2.0.0),\n[DeepVariant](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/TvIl) [(v1.5.0), and Clair3](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/pnGg) (v1.0.4). The same callers and versions were run for ONT\n[except for PBSV and DeepVariant was executed through PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/sLno) (r0.8).\nThe callset process was the same for both references.\n\n[SV-Pop](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy) was used to merge PAV calls from minimap2 alignments and generate per-sample\nsupport information from all other callers. Calls in T2T-CHM13 were filtered if they intersected\nthe UCSC \u201cCenSat\u201d track for T2T-CHM13 (UCSC hs1) with monomeric (\u201cmon\u201d) records\nexcluded or if they were in telomere repeats. GRCh38 variants intersecting modeled\n\ncentromeres were removed.\n\n## Mobile element insertions\n\nMobile element insertions (MEIs) were identified within the 130 sample haplotype assemblies\nusing two separate pipelines and human references (T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38). One detection\npipeline, L1ME-AID (v1.0.0-beta) (L1 Mediated Annotation and Insertion Detector) (Code\n**[Availability), leverages a local RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UT7O1)** (v4.1.6) installation with the Dfam (v3.8)\n[database](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/p6z5) to annotate the freeze4 PAV-merged SV insertion callsets (T2T-CHM13 and\nGRCh38). The second pipeline called MEIs directly from the sample PacBio HiFi raw sequence\nreads with PALMER2 (Code Availability). Putative MEIs from both callers were merged using\nMEI coordinates, element family (Alu, L1, SVA, HERV-K, or snRNA), and sequence composition\n(Supplementary Methods). Next, MEIs were curated to distinguish MEIs from deletions\n(T2T-CHM13 or GRCh38), duplications, or potential artifacts (e.g., possible genome assembly\nerrors; Supplementary Methods). All MEIs called by a single pipeline that passed QC were\nmanually curated. Finally, both callsets were compared against an orthogonal MEI callset\nproduced by MELT-LRA (Supplementary Methods, Code Availability). To determine intact\n[ORFs across LINE-1 elements, we followed a previously described method](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy) to detect intact\nORF1p and ORF2p from full-length (>5,900 bp) LINE-1 insertions.\n\n[Separately, MEIs within centromere HOR arrays were identified with RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UT7O1) (v4.1.6),\n[and the Dfam library](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/p6z5) (v3.8), annotation of complete and accurately assembled centromeres\n(see Centromeres Methods). The sequences of Alu elements, L1s, and SVAs identified by\n[RepeatMasker within the centromere HOR array boundaries were retrieved using SAMtools](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/A7Qs)\n\n(v1.15.1). Element sequences were then scrutinized with L1ME-AID (v1.0.0-beta) utilizing the\nsame cutoffs applied to the freeze4 PAV-merged SV insertion callset to distinguish young MEIs\nfrom older mobile element fragments. Sequence of all putative MEIs that passed filtering were\n[re-retrieved along with flanking sequence (+/-100 bp) using SAMtools](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ExY5) (v1.15.1), and then\n[aligned against one another using MUSCLE](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/jsBD) (v3.38.31) to distinguish unique MEIs from\nduplicated insertions of MEIs residing in centromere regions (Supplementary Table 60).\n\n## Inversions\n\nWe performed validation of the T2T-CHM13-based and GRCh38-based PAV inversion callsets,\nindividually, using Strand-seq-based re-genotyping of the inversion calls. Prior to genotyping, we\n\n\n-----\n\n[performed Strand-seq cell selection using ASHLEYS. The good quality Strand-seq cells were](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Vu8U)\n[used as input to perform genotyping by ArbiGent.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/if3Yd)\n\nWe evaluated the PAV inversion callset for one candidate carrier sample per region using\n[manual dotplot analysis with NAHRwhals. NAHRwhals was applied to detect the FDR and](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UVZFl)\nclassify all candidate inversion regions larger than 5 kbp into distinct inversion classes.\n\nWe compared the PAV inversion callset reported with respect to T2T-CHM13 to a previously\n[published callset](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/OYzdp) based on a subset of samples reported in this study. Using the 25%\nreciprocal overlap criterion, we define inversions detected in both callsets as well as inversions\nthat are new to the current study. We evaluate all novel inversion candidates manually using\ndotplot analysis of each putative novel inversion.\n\n## Segmental duplication and copy number polymorphic genes\n\n_[Identification of segmental duplications (SDs). SD annotation was performed using SEDEF](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/9DO2)_\n\n[(v1.1) after masking repeats [TRF](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/S652) [(v.4.1.0), RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/7uIM) [(v4.1.5), and Windowmasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ClWb)\n\n(v2.2.22)]. SDs with sequence identity >90%, length >1 kbp, satellite content <70%, and free of\nputative erroneous regions (NucFreq or Flagger) were retained. Additionally, the highly confident\nSD callset was further validated by fastCN. Comparative analysis of SDs was conducted in\nT2T-CHM13 space. Positions of the SDs in T2T-CHM13 were mapped as follows: 1) linking SDs\nwithin 10 kbp distance, 2) identifying those SD chains that are located in alignment block of at\nleast 100 kbp in size, and 3) projecting the chained SDs onto putative homologous SD loci\ncontaining at least one 10 kbp unique flank. Additionally, syntenic SDs were further assessed\n[whether they share sequence content by aligning SDs with minimap2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CGKK) (v2.26); the following\nSDs were quantified: 1) SDs unobserved by T2T-CHM13, 2) having changed sequence content,\nand 3) expanded size (at least twofold).\n\n_Duplicated genes. Protein-coding transcripts from GENCODE v44 were aligned to the genome_\nassemblies (excluding NA19650, NA19434 and NA21487) using minimap2. The mapped genes\nwere further filtered to exclude alignments due to nested repeats, keeping minimum length of 2\nkbp, percent identity of >90%, and coverage of >80%. Multi-copy genes were determined by\nmaximum gene counts greater than one. Variable copy number genes were defined by\nassessing the copy number across the population (at least one of the genome assemblies with\ndifferent copy number).\n\n## Y chromosome variation\n\n_Construction and dating of Y phylogeny. The construction and dating of Y-chromosomal_\nphylogeny combining the 30 males from the current study plus two males (HG01106 and\nHG01952 from the HPRC year 1 dataset for which contiguous Yq12 assemblies were used from\n[Ref. 36) was done as previously described. Detailed descriptions of methods are available](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4I9rC)\n(Supplementary Methods). Please note that the male sample HG03456 appears to have a\n[XYY karyotype as reported in Ref. 45.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/plUNR)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Identification of sex-chromosome contigs. Contigs containing Y-chromosomal sequences from_\nthe whole-genome assemblies were identified and extracted for the 30 male samples as\n[previously described. Y assemblies for the two HPRC samples HG01106 and HG01952 were](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4I9rC)\nused from Ref. [.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4I9rC)\n\n_Y chromosome annotation and analysis. The annotation of Y-chromosomal subregions was_\nperformed as previously described using both the GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 Y reference\n[sequences. The centromeric \u03b1-satellite repeats for the purpose of Y subregion annotation](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4I9rC)\n[were identified using RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UT7O1) (v4.1.2-p1). The Yq12 repeat annotations were generated\n[using HMMER v.3.3.2dev](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Yg6E) and identification of Alu insertions was performed as previously\n[described. In order to maximize the number of contiguously assembled Yq12 subregions,](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/4I9rC)\nhifiasm assemblies of this subregion were analyzed from four samples (NA19239, HG03065,\nNA19347, HG00358) following manual inspection of the assembled sequences\n\n(Supplementary Table 42).\n\n[Dotplots to compare Y-chromosomal sequences were generated using Gepard v2.0. While we](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/JUfG)\nalso assembled the T2T (NA24385/HG002) Y as a single contig (Supplementary Table 42), all\n[analyses conducted here used the existing published T2T assembly.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/meooF)\n\nVisualization of eight completely assembled Y chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 23) was\n[based on pairwise alignments generated using minimap2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CGKK+af9h) (v2.26) with the following options:\n-x asm20 -c -p 0.95 --cap-kalloc=1g -K4g -I8g -L --MD --eqx. For visualization, alignments <10\nkbp in length were filtered out. Additionally, alignments were broken at SVs \u226550 bp in size and\nthen binned in 50 kbp bins.\n\n## SVs affecting genes\n\nWe annotated the potential impact of long-read SVs on genes using the coding transcripts and\n[exons defined in GENCODE](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/cAmN) [(v39), as per Ensembl VEP](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/bpt7J) (v105). Long-read deletions or\ninsertions are classified as coding overlapping events if at least one breakpoint falls within the\ncoding exons of a gene. We consider genes that have a LOEUF score under 0.35 as intolerant\n[to LoF variants. To specifically analyze the potential impact of MEIs on genes, the merged](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/JLOh0)\n[GRCh38 MEI callset was intersected with the findings from Ensembl](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/dyJx) [(release 111) VEP](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/bpt7J)\n\n(see transcriptional effect of SVs below). The MEIs were categorized by insertion location (e.g.,\nprotein-coding exons, UTRs of protein-coding transcripts, and noncoding exons) and within\neach category the number of MEIs present, genes disrupted, and transcripts affected were\nquantified. The Ensembl VEP nonsense mediated decay (NMD) plugin\n\n(https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/112/NMD.pm) was utilized to predict\n\nwhich protein-coding transcripts with MEI-induced premature stop codons would escape NMD.\nTranscripts were further scrutinized by manually comparing the MEI location within the transcript\n[sequence using the UCSC Genome Browser.

Protein-coding genes impacted by putative exon disruptions were\nevaluated for evidence of Iso-Seq expression across the 12 samples. Isoforms associated with\n\n\n-----\n\nthese SV-containing genes were screened for the presence of unreported splice variants using\n[SQANTI3](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/r3IN) (v5.1.2). All isoforms of these candidate genes were aligned to GRCh38p14 using\n[pbmm2 (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2) (v1.5.0) and visualized with IGV](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/85ld) to\nidentify variant-specific patterns. We compared all isoforms phased to variant haplotypes to\n[known transcripts represented in RefSeq, CHESS, and GENCODE](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/RfFqL) gene annotation\n[databases to identify novel splice products and isoforms. MUSCLE](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/jsBD) [(v3.8.425) and Aliview](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/MNhT)\n\nwere used to perform a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and visualize the MSA, respectively,\nbetween wild-type and variant haplotype assemblies to identify SV breakpoints.\n\nWe next assessed SVs for enrichment near genes with altered expression in the 12 samples\nwith Iso-Seq data. Using gene expression quantifications from short-read RNA-seq data, we\n[performed differential expression analysis using DESeq2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/YyIO) between individuals who carried and\ndid not carry each SV, supplemented with outlier expression analysis for singleton SVs, and\nidentified 122 SVs that were within 50 kbp of a GENCODE v45 annotated gene with significantly\n[altered expression (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p<0.05). Permutation tests showed an](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/cAmN)\nenrichment of SVs (empirical p<0.001) adjacent to genes with differential expression\n\n(Supplementary Methods: \u201cTranscriptional Effects of SVs\u201d). Additionally, we assessed SV\noverlap with multiple GENCODE v45-derived genomic elements, such as protein-coding and\n[pseudogene classes, and ENCODE-derived candidate cis-regulatory elements](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/cAmN) (cCREs),\nusing permutation tests to find enrichment or depletion of SVs for each annotation.\n\nAmong the 128 SV gene pairs (122 unique SVs associated with 98 genes) that exhibit\nsignificant differential gene expression changes in the 12 samples with Iso-Seq data, we first\nfiltered out SVs with missing genotypes in 6 or more out of 12 samples. For each remaining SV,\nwe extracted the 50 kbp upstream and downstream of the annotated transcription start site\n(TSS) position for each paired gene with corresponding insulation scores under 10 kbp\nresolution (Supplementary Methods). For those insulated regions intersecting with more than\none SV, we applied a local multi-test correction. An FDR <0.05 from the two-sided Wilcoxon\nrank-sum test was considered significant. We investigated the association between variants and\nhuman phenotypes or traits by intersecting SNVs, indels, and SVs with SNPs identified in\nGWAS. We downloaded the GWAS summary statistics\n\n[(gwas_catalog_v1.0.2-associations_e111_r2024-04-16.tsv),](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/37M4t) which contains 149,081\n\nautosomal SNPs and we observed 1,547 SVs are at least one bp overlap with any GWAS\n[signal. We used Plink](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/sTED) (v1.90b6.10) to examine the linkage disequilibrium between SNVs,\nindels, and SVs with GWAS SNPs within 1 Mbp window size.\n\n## Genome-wide genotyping with PanGenie\n\n[We built a pangenome graph containing 214 haplotypes with Minigraph-Cactus](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/XoI9b) (v2.7.2) from\n[the haplotype-resolved assemblies of 65 HGSVC samples and 42 samples from the HPRC](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj) and\nproduced a CHM13-based VCF representation of the top-level bubbles of the graph that can be\nused as input for genotyping with PanGenie (Supplementary Methods). This was done by\nconverted genotypes of male sex chromosomes to a homozygous representation, filtering out\nrecords for which at least 20% of haplotypes carry a missing allele (\".\") and running our\npreviously developed decomposition approach to detect and annotate variant alleles nested\ninside of graph bubbles (Supplementary Methods). We genotyped all 30,490,169 bubbles\n(representing 28,343,728 SNPs, 10,421,787 indels and 547,663 SVs) across all 3,202 1kGP\n[samples based on short reads](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/plUNR) [using PanGenie](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/79YCm) (v3.1.0).

We filtered out variants reported with a genotype quality below 10 and ran**\n[SHAPEIT5](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/ncGrG) phase_common (v5.1.1) in order to phase this joint callset. We used the resulting\nreference panel in order to reconstruct personal genomes for all 3,202 samples by implanting\n[phased variants into the CHM13 reference genome with BCFtools](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/A7Qs) in order to create the 6,404\nconsensus haplotype sequences of all 1kGP samples (Supplementary Methods).\n\n## Targeted genotyping of complex polymorphic loci\n\nTargeted genotyping was performed using [Locityper](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/hcz2f) (v0.15.1) across 347 complex\n\npolymorphic target loci. Based on the input short-read WGS data, at each of the targets\nLocityper aims to identify two haplotypes from the reference panel that are most similar to the\ninput data. Three reference panels were used: HPRC haplotypes (90 haplotypes); HPRC +\nHGSVC3 haplotypes (216 haplotypes); and leave-one-out HPRC + HGSVC3 panel (LOO; 214\nhaplotypes), where two assemblies corresponding to the input dataset were removed. To\nevaluate prediction accuracy, we constructed sequence alignments between actual and\npredicted haplotypes and estimated QVs as Phred-like transformed sequence divergences.\nLocityper accuracy is limited by haplotypes present in the reference panel; consequently, we\nevaluated haplotype availability QV as the highest Phred-scaled sequence divergence between\nactual assembled haplotypes and any haplotype from the reference panel. See Supplementary\n**Methods for more details.**\n\n## Major histocompatibility complex\n\nImmuannot-based HLA types were compared in two-field resolution to the HLA typing published\nearlier and obtained with [PolyPheMe](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zojB0)\n\n[(http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HLA_types/20181129_HLA_types_fu](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HLA_types/20181129_HLA_types_full_1000_Genomes_Project_panel.txt)\n[ll_1000_Genomes_Project_panel.txt). Of the 130 haplotypes, 58 are not in the PolyPheMe](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HLA_types/20181129_HLA_types_full_1000_Genomes_Project_panel.txt)\ndataset and were excluded. In addition to Immuannot (MHC reference version:\n\n[IPD-IMGT/HLA-V3.55.0), haplotypes were annotated using MHC-annotation v0.1 (Code](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/TvkfI)\n**Availability). Cases of overlapping genes were resolved after inspection by removing**\nsuperfluous annotations. Reported gene counts for HLA genes and C4 annotation were based\non Immuannot.\n\nTo search for structural variation in the DRB gene region, HGSVC MHC haplotypes were cut\nfrom [start of DRA] to [end of DRB1 + 20 kbp]. The coordinates were obtained using\n\n\n-----\n\nMHC-annotation v0.1. Based on their DRB1-allele as determined by Immuannot (see above),\nthe sequences were grouped into DR groups. Within each group, every sequence was aligned\n[with nucmer](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/rp7A) (v3.1) (-nosimplify -maxmatch) to the same sequence (arbitrarily selected as the\nsequence with the alphanumerically smallest ID) and plotted with a custom gnuplot script based\non mummerplots output. Sequences were annotated as follows:\n\n1. [Repeat elements were masked with RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UT7O1) (v4.1.2)\n\n2. Full DRB genes and pseudogenes were searched for with minimap 2.26\n\n(--secondary=no -c -x --asm10 -s100) by aligning the sequence from (1) against all DRB\nalleles from IMGT and the larger DRB9 sequence Z80362.1; results were highlighted\nand masked for the next step\n\n3. [DRB exons were searched for with BLASTN](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/R2vt) (2.14.1) by aligning all DRB exons from\nIMGT to the sequence and filtering for highest matches; results where highlighted and\nmasked for the next step\n\n4. As step 3 but with introns\n\n[For each HGSVC MHC haplotype, SVs were called with PAV](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/n1Tgy) against eight completely resolved\n[MHC reference haplotypes. To determine which SVs in the HGSVC haplotypes were not](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Y7d7X+EpWge)\npresent in any of the eight reference haplotypes, for each HGSVC haplotype, the \u201cquery\u201d\ncoordinates (i.e., the coordinates of the calls relative to the analyzed HGSVC haplotype) of the\nPAV calls were padded with 50 bp on each side and the intersection of SV calls (based on the\npadded \u201cquery\u201d coordinates, across the eight MHC reference sequences) was computed. Only\nvariants longer than 50 bp were included for further analysis and the smallest variant relative to\nany of the eight MHC references was reported. The sequences of the calls so-defined were\n[annotated with RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UT7O1) (v4.1.2).Variants were grouped by starting position on their\nclosest MHC reference sequence and, in the case of insertions, repeat content was averaged.\n\nWe applied Immuannot (see above) to all retrieved MHC loci for the identification and annotation\nof protein-coding HLA-DRB genes (-DRB1, -DRB3, -DRB4, and -DRB5). Subsequently, a\n[custom RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UT7O1) (v4.1.2) library was constructed containing the exonic sequences of\nHLA-DRB pseudogenes (-DRB2:ENSG00000227442.1, -DRB6:ENSG00000229391.8,\n\n-DRB7:ENSG00000227099.1, -DRB8:ENSG00000233697.2, and\n\n-DRB9:ENSG00000196301.3) and RCCX genes and pseudogenes (C4:ENSG00000244731.10,\n_CYP21A2:ENSG00000231852.9,_ _CYP21A1P:ENSG00000204338.9,_\n\n_STK19/RP1:ENSG00000204344.16,_ _STK19B/STK19P/RP2:ENSG00000250535.1,_\n\n_TNXB:ENSG00000168477.21, and TNXA:ENSG00000248290.1). Canonical exonic sequences_\nwere sourced from the Ensembl genome [browser](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/dyJx) (release 111). The exons of\n\nHLA-DRB/RCCX genes and pseudogenes within individual haplotype MHC regions were\nannotated using this custom library. Repetitive elements were identified using RepeatMasker\n[(v4.1.2) with the Dfam library](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/p6z5) [(v3.4). We utilized SAMtools](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/A7Qs) [(v1.15.1) and MUSCLE](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/jsBD)\n\n(v3.8.31) for sequence retrieval and alignment, respectively, followed by manual annotation to\nanalyze recombination events associated with DR subregion haplotypes and within the RCCX\nmodules (Supplementary **Methods).** Novel _C4-coding variants were identified through_\n\ncomparison with Ensembl C4A and C4B protein variant tables, as well as an additional\n[database of variants obtained from 95 human MHC haplotypes.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/BdTeo)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Complex structural polymorphisms\n\nComplex structural variants (CSVs) were identified with a development version of PAV (methods\navailable at 10.5281/zenodo.13800981). Briefly, the method identifies candidate variant anchors\nand scores variants between them. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is constructed with\nalignment records as nodes and variants connecting them as edges, which is solved in O(N + E)\n[time with the Bellman-ford algorithm. Variants on the optimal path are accepted into the](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/z0nd)\ncallset. CSVs intersecting centromeric repeats were eliminated. CSVs were merged into a\nnonredundant callset with SV-Pop by 50% reciprocal overlap and 80% sequence identity.\n\nWe evaluated complexity and copy number of SMN genes by extracting with FASTA the desired\nregion (chr5:70300000-72100000) from assemblies reported in this study along with previously\n[published assemblies. Among these, we identify 101 fully assembled haplotypes. We follow](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/zllBj+rpeD)\nby aligning exon sequences for multicopy genes (SMN1/2, SERF1A/B, NAIP and GTF2H2/C) to\neach assembled haplotype. To assign a specific SMN copy to each haplotype, we extracted\nFASTA sequence from SMN exon regions for each haplotype and concatenated them into a\nsingle sequence. We then constructed a MSA and calculated the distance among all\nhaplotypes. We set the orangutan sequence as an outgroup and split all human haplotypes into\ntwo groups representing SMN1 and SMN2 gene copies where the SMN1 copy is the one closer\nto the outgroup.\n\n## Centromeres\n\n_Centromere identification and annotation. To identify the centromeric regions within each Verkko_\nand hifiasm (UL) genome assembly, we first aligned the whole-genome assemblies to the\n[T2T-CHM13 (v2.0) reference genome](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/m0xQz) [using minimap2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CGKK) (v2.24) with the following parameters:\n-ax asm20 --secondary=no -s 25000 -K 15G --eqx --cs. We filtered the alignments to only those\n[contigs that traversed each human centromere, from the p- to the q-arm, using BEDtools](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/S1tKd)\n\n[(v2.29.0) intersect. Then, we ran dna-brnn](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/dYPR) (v0.1) on each centromeric contig to identify\nregions containing \u03b1-satellite sequences, as indicated by a \u201c2\u201d. Once we identified the regions\n[containing \u03b1-satellite sequences, we ran RepeatMasker](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/UT7O1) (v4.1.0) to identify all repeat elements\nand their organization within the centromeric region; we also ran Hum-AS-HMMER\n\n(https://github.com/fedorrik/HumAS-HMMER_for_AnVIL) to identify \u03b1-satellite HOR sequence\ncomposition and organization. We used the resulting RepeatMasker and HumAS-AMMER\n[stv_row.bed file to visualize the organization of the \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays with R](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/HwUlm) (v1.1.383)\n[and the ggplot2 package.](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/uKtWT)\n\n\n_Validation of centromeric regions. We validated the construction of each centromeric region by_\nfirst aligning native PacBio HiFi and ONT data from the same genome to each relevant\nwhole-genome assembly using pbmm2 (v1.1.0; for PacBio HiFi data;\n\n[https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2) or minimap2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CGKK) (v2.28; for ONT data). We, then,\n[assessed the assemblies for uniform read depth across the centromeric regions via IGV](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/85ld) and\n[NucFreq. Centromeres that were found to have a collapse in sequence, false duplication of](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/Tx6pb)\nsequence, and/or misjoin were flagged and removed from our analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Estimation of \u03b1-satellite HOR array length. To estimate the length of the \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays_\nfor each human centromere, we first ran Hum-AS-HMMER\n\n[(https://github.com/fedorrik/HumAS-HMMER_for_AnVIL) on the centromeric regions using the](https://github.com/fedorrik/HumAS-HMMER_for_AnVIL)\nhmmer-run.sh script and the AS-HORs-hmmer3.0-170921.hmm Hidden Markov Model. Then,\nwe used the stv_row.bed file to calculate the length of the \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays by taking the\nminimum and maximum coordinate of the \u201clive\u201d \u03b1-satellite HOR arrays, marked by an \u201cL\u201d, and\nplotting their lengths with Graphpad Prism (v9).\n\n_Pairwise sequence identity heatmaps. To generate pairwise sequence identity heatmaps of_\n[each centromeric region, we ran StainedGlass](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/tuzKZ) (v6.7.0) with the following parameters:\nwindow=5000, mm_f=30000, and mm_s=1000. We normalized the color scale across the\nStainedGlass plots by binning the percent sequence identities equally and recoloring the data\npoints according to the binning.\n\n_CpG methylation analysis. To determine the CpG methylation status of each centromere, we_\naligned ONT reads >30 kbp in length from the same source genome to the relevant\n[whole-genome assembly via minimap2](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/CGKK) (v2.28) and then assessed the CpG methylation\nstatus of the centromeric regions with Epi2me modbam2bed\n\n(https://github.com/epi2me-labs/modbam2bed; v0.10.0) and the following parameters: -e -m\n5mC --cpg. We converted the resulting BED file to a bigWig using the bedGraphToBigWig tool\n(https://www.encodeproject.org/software/bedgraphtobigwig/) and then visualized the file in IGV.\nTo determine the length of the hypomethylated region (termed \u201ccentromere dip region\u201d, or\n[CDR](https://paperpile.com/c/Ckg9ZJ/eZybW+8yv9w) in each centromere, we used CDR-Finder\n\n[(https://github.com/EichlerLab/CDR-Finder_smk).

Current approaches comparing trajectories often use dynamic programming but are limited by assumptions such as the existence of a defnitive match. Here we describe Genes2Genes, a Bayesian information-theoretic dynamic programming framework for aligning single-cell trajectories. It is able to capture sequential matches and mismatches of individual genes between a reference and query trajectory, highlighting distinct clusters of alignment patterns. Across both real world and simulated datasets, it accurately inferred alignments and demonstrated its utility in disease cell-state trajectory analysis. In a proof-of-concept application, Genes2Genes revealed that T cells diferentiated in vitro match an immature in vivo state while lacking expression of genes associated with TNF signaling. This demonstrates that precise trajectory alignment can pinpoint divergence from the in vivo system, thus guiding the optimization of in vitro culture conditions.\n\n\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n\n\nSingle-cell technologies, especially single-cell RNA sequencing\n(scRNA-seq), have revolutionized our understanding of biology and\nopened up new avenues of research. Their ability to observe thousands\nof genes per cell simultaneously enables the description of transitional\ncell states and dynamic cellular processes (for example differentiation/\ndevelopment; response to perturbations). The computational task\nof deriving a \u2018timeline\u2019 for a dynamic process (for example based on\ntranscriptomic similarity) is referred to as \u2018pseudotime trajectory inference\u2019[,]. One key challenge is how to compare two (or more) trajectories,\n\n\nfor example in control versus drug treatment groups, or in vitro cell\ndifferentiation versus in vivo cell development (Fig. 1a) where identifying differentially regulated genes can guide us to refine in vitro cell\ndifferentiation.\n\nTrajectory comparison poses a time series alignment problem,\n\nwhich is addressable using dynamic programming (DP). A popular DP\nalgorithm to align two single-cell trajectories is dynamic time warping\n(DTW). The goal is an optimal mapping (pairwise sequential correspondences between the time points of two single-cell trajectories),\n\n\n1Wellcome Sanger Institute; Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK. 2Theory of Condensed Matter, Cavendish Laboratory, Department\nof Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

G2G utilizes a DP\nalgorithm that handles matches and mismatches in a formal way, by\ncombining the classical Gotoh\u2019s algorithm with DTW and employing\na Bayesian information-theoretic scoring scheme to quantify distances\nof gene expression distributions. This overcomes ad hoc thresholding\nand/or post hoc processing of typical DTW outputs (as in TrAGEDy, the\nrecent advancement built on CellAlign). G2G (1) generates descriptive\ngene alignments; (2) identifies gene clusters of similar alignment patterns; (3) derives aggregate, cell-level alignment across all or subset of\ngenes; (4) identifies genes with differential dynamic expression; and\n(5) explores their associated biological pathways.\n\nWe validate G2G\u2019s ability to accurately capture different alignment\n\npatterns in simulated datasets, benchmarking against CellAlign and\nTrAGEDy (the current state-of-the-art of single-cell trajectory alignment) and demonstrate gene-level alignment between two conditions\nin a published real dataset.

Finally, we\nshow how G2G aligns in vitro and in vivo T cell development, finding that\nTNF signaling in in vivo T cell maturation is not recapitulated in vitro and\nvalidate G2G\u2019s use for optimizing in vitro cell engineering.\n\n### Results\n##### Genes2Genes aligns trajectories using dynamic programming\nG2G is a new DP framework to infer and analyze gene trajectory alignments between a single-cell reference and query. Given a reference\nsequence ( |R| |Q|\n_R_ {Ri}i=1[) and query sequence ][Q][ (][{][Q][i][}]i=1[), two discrete series ]\n\nof time points, a computational alignment between them can inform\nus of the one-to-one matches, one-to-many matches (expansion warps),\nmany-to-one matches (compression warps) and indels between their\ntime points in sequential order, denoted by the five states: M,V,W,I,D,\nrespectively (Fig. 1b). While matches imply similarity between transcriptomic states of and, indels (also called gaps) imply mismatches\n_R_ _Q_\n(differential/unobserved transcriptomic states compared to each\nother). A standard DP alignment algorithm optimizes the mapping\nbetween two sequences by constructing a pairwise cost matrix and\ngenerating the path that minimizes the total cost (Fig. 1c). This uses a\nscoring scheme to quantify correspondences between every pair of\n_R_\nand time points.\n_Q_\n\nUnlike DTW and biological sequence alignment, G2G implements\n\na DP algorithm that handles both matches (including warps) and mismatches jointly, querying each gene. This extends Gotoh\u2019s three-state\nalgorithm (defining time-efficient DP recurrences with affine gap\nscheme[\u2013] over M,I,D states) to accommodate V,W warp states\n\n**Fig. 3 | Genes2Genes outperforms the current state-of-the-art of trajectory**\n**alignment.** **a, Differences in the algorithms and outputs of CellAlign, TrAGEDy**\nand G2G.

G2G first interpolates\neach gene expression trajectory. This initially transforms the pseudotime\naxis to the  range using min\u2013max normalization, over which we take\na predefined number of equispaced interpolation time points, similar to\nCellAlign. For each interpolation time point, we estimate gene expression as a Gaussian distribution, considering all cells kernel-weighted by\ntheir pseudotime distance to this interpolation time point.\n\nThe interpolated gene trajectories of the reference and query\n\nare aligned using our DP algorithm, generating optimal gene alignments described as five-state strings (Fig. 1d and top right matrix of\nFig. 2). The five-state string of a gene informs the percentage of match\ncalling (M,V,W), termed \u2018alignment similarity\u2019. (Note that under symmetric costs, the alignment string is symmetric regardless of which\ndataset is the reference, only swapping between symmetric states\nI-D, W-V). The pairwise Levenshtein distance matrix between these\nstrings can be used to reveal the diversity of gene alignments (for\nexample 100% mismatched, 100% matched, 30% early-matched and\nlate-mismatched), by running agglomerative hierarchical clustering\n(where an optimal grouping is determined by inspecting the mean\nsilhouette coefficients under different distance thresholds of the\nlinkage criterion). G2G generates a representative alignment for a\ncluster by aggregating its gene-level alignments (for example cluster\nof 100% matches represented by a string over M,V,W; cluster of 100%\n\nof the pairwise Levenshtein distance matrix across all G2G alignments, separating\nthe distinct patterns using agglomerative hierarchical clustering (right).\n**g, Comparing hierarchical clustering of the gene alignments generated by**\nCellAlign, TrAGEDy and G2G; x axis is the number of clusters (representing\nvarying clustering resolutions) in log scale; y axis is the mis-clustering rate (outlier\npercentage across all clusters). h, Cell-level alignment of two simulated\ntrajectories with no shared process, with three example gene alignments\ngenerated by TrAGEDy and G2G.

G2G finally aggregates\nall gene-level alignments into a single, cell-level alignment, informing\nan average mapping between the trajectories. Both gene-level and\ncell-level alignments are useful when the alignment patterns are heterogeneous across genes. Altogether, these enable downstream analysis\n(for example gene set over-representation analysis).\n\n**G2G expands the capacity of DTW. G2G infers statistically-consistent**\nmatches and mismatches between reference and query time points.\nSuch output is impossible from DTW (for example CellAlign) as it\nmaps all time points including those with transcriptomic differences\n(Fig. 3a). One could perform local DTW with user-defined thresholds or\npost hoc processing of DTW alignment (as in TrAGEDy) to unmap dissimilar time points, yet the underlying assumption of a definite match\nremains. This is particularly problematic for datasets with no shared\nprocess. In contrast, G2G systematically disconnects mismatching\ntime points without thresholding or post-processing (see Fig. 3a,b and\nSupplementary Table 1 for summarized comparison of the features\nthat fundamentally distinguish G2G from CellAlign and TrAGEDy).\n\n##### G2G captures different alignment patterns in simulated data\nTo benchmark G2G against CellAlign and TrAGEDy, we experimented\non (1) a dataset with seven alignment patterns; (2) a real dataset with\nartificial perturbations; and (3) a negative control dataset. CellAlign\nand TrAGEDy alignments were converted into five-state strings before\ncomparison. TrAGEDy prunes DTW matches based on a \u2018minimum\ndissimilarity score\u2019 (hereafter, \u2018TrAGEDyMINIMUM\u2019), with an alternative\nto disregard the minimum (hereafter, \u2018TrAGEDyNULL\u2019).\n\n**Experiment 1. We simulated 3,500 pairs of matching, divergence and**\nconvergence trajectories with seven distinct patterns (Fig. 3c and\nExtended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c; Methods). Each trajectory comprises 300 cells\nspread across pseudotime range . Divergence and convergence\ngroups represent early, mid and late bifurcation (approximately at time\npoints (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75), respectively). We examined alignments\nfor each pattern under 15 interpolation time points. The expected tb \u2208\nalignments were: 100% match for matching; matched region\n(start-match) + mismatched region (end-mismatch) for divergence;\nand mismatched region (start-mismatch) + matched region\n(end-match) for convergence. The match/mismatch lengths for divergence/convergence depend on (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). We used\n_tb_\nthe accuracy rate (proportion of correct alignments) to fine-tune the\nfive-state machine parameters set by G2G as default (Methods and\nSupplementary Table 2).\n\nFigure 3d,e reports cell-level alignments from all methods. Both\n\nG2G and TrAGEDy correctly described the seven patterns (Fig. 3e). In\ncontrast, CellAlign could not describe divergence and convergence\n\n**Fig. 4 | Genes2Genes captures matches and mismatches at gene-level**\n**resolution.** **a, G2G alignment on a published time-course dataset[,] of murine**\nbone-marrow-derived dendritic cells stimulated with PAM (reference) or LPS\n(query). b, Aggregate alignment over the alignments of 99 \u2018core antiviral\u2019 genes\n(top).

Across all patterns, G2G outperformed TrAGEDy in gene-level\nalignment (Fig. 3f left) with higher accuracy rates of 98.6%, 99.4%,\n99.8%, 100%, 99.2%, 98.2% and 99.2%, for matching, divergence (early,\nmid and late) and convergence (early, mid and late) pairs, respectively. All distributions of match/mismatch lengths in divergence/\nconvergence alignments fell within the expected ranges (Extended\nData Fig. 2a,b). TrAGEDyMINIMUM gave 66.26%, 28.57%, 95.87%, 96.86%,\n97.35, 96.15 and 88.2% accuracy rates, respectively, with divergence/\nconvergence alignments showing higher variability in their match/\nmismatch lengths, thus falling beyond the expected ranges. TrAGEDyNULL gave 68.2%, 5.4%, 88%, 100%, 100%, 88% and 5.8% accuracy rates,\nrespectively, with better length distributions than TrAGEDyMINIMUM. G2G\nshowed fewer false mismatches on average for matching alignments\ncompared to TrAGEDy, while also having fewer intermediate false mismatches compared to TrAGEDyMINIMUM. Notably, TrAGEDyNULL generated\nno intermediate false mismatches, yet yielded higher inaccuracy due\nto 100% matched or expected-order-swapped alignments.\n\nG2G clustering separated the patterns very well (Fig. 3f, right);\n\nhierarchical clustering of alignments at the optimally chosen 0.22\ndistance threshold gave 15 clusters, with only a 0.1% mis-clustering\nrate. (Extended Data Fig. 2c; see Methods for details on optimal threshold selection). We compared this to CellAlign\u2019s k-means clustering of\ngenes based on their pseudotime shifts (differences between matched\ntime points in gene-level DTW alignments). All mis-clustering rates\nwere substantially higher (falling within the range of 42.6% and 60.4%)\nfor k (Extended Data Fig. 2d) than G2G\u2019s mis-clustering rate.\n\u2208\nCellAlign and TrAGEDy displayed higher noise and mis-clustering rates\ncompared to G2G (Fig. 3g).\n\n**Experiment 2. To test G2G\u2019s match detection in scRNA-seq data, we**\nused a murine pancreatic development dataset subsetted to \u03b2-cell\nlineage (1,845 cells), considering 769 lineage-driver genes. We randomly\nsplit cells into reference and query, and simulated mismatches as a\ndeleted portion (perturbation scenario 1) or changed portion (perturbation scenario 2) of increasing size at the beginning of the trajectory\n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). We then performed gene-level alignments\nusing G2G and TrAGEDy (under 50 interpolation time points) for each\nscenario and calculated their alignment similarities (Extended Data\nFig. 3b,c). For perturbation scenario 1, both G2G and TrAGEDy alignment similarity decreased with increasing deletion sizes as expected\nacross smaller perturbation sizes, although the detected mismatch\nlength was shorter than expected for deletions larger than 20%. This\nis due to the relatively nonvarying gene expression between pseudotime bin 10\u201320 (Extended Data Fig. 3d), which caused warps instead of\nmismatches. Both methods were consistent in capturing this behavior.\nFor perturbation scenario 2, alignment similarity had an expected\nmaximum and minimum (Extended Data Fig. 3e).

Notably, TrAGEDyNULL outperformed\nTrAGEDyMINIMUM in both scenarios. TrAGEDyNULL also showed higher\naccuracy for perturbation sizes <6%. Overall, G2G and TrAGEDyNULL\nclosely performed with better match detection than TrAGEDyMINIMUM;\nhowever, G2G showed relatively less variability in results overall.\n\n**Experiment 3. Examining two simulated datasets with no shared**\nprocess (referred to as negative control, tested by TrAGEDy), G2G\ngenerated an aggregate alignment of 100% mismatch as expected,\nwhereas TrAGEDy falsely inferred match segments (Fig. 3h); similar\nresults were observed for three genes with completely mismatched\ntrajectories.\n\nIn conclusion, G2G outperformed existing methods by accurately\n\naligning and clustering genes with different alignment patterns.\n\n##### G2G captures matches and mismatches at gene-level resolution\nTo further demonstrate our framework\u2019s features, we performed G2G\nalignment on the time-course dataset tested by CellAlign (Fig. 4a).\nThis involved murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells treated with\nPAM3CSK (PAM) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate responses to\ndifferent pathogens.\n\nG2G\u2019s ability to capture mismatches is revealed when aligning\n\ngenes from the \u2018core antiviral module\u2019 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). CellAlign demonstrated a \u2018lag\u2019 in gene expression after PAM stimulation\ncompared to LPS, which was also captured by G2G aggregate alignment (Fig. 4b). In addition, G2G identified mismatches in the early and\nlate pseudotime points. Clustering alignments revealed low diversity,\nimplying that all genes generally follow the average pattern (Extended\nData Fig. 4b). At early pseudotime points, the gene expression was\nconsistently low in the PAM condition, whereas some LPS-stimulated\ncells were already showing elevated expression (for example IRF7,\n_STAT2 and IF1T1; Fig. 4c). These have also been noticed and described_\nas \u2018precocious expressers\u2019 in the original paper. The mismatch in\nlate LPS pseudotime points was caused by the peaked expression,\nwhereas the expression of PAM-stimulated cells was still on the rise,\nnot yet reaching a peak.\n\nFor genes in the \u2018peaked inflammatory module\u2019, Fig. 4d shows their\n\nG2G aggregate alignment. Clustering of genes revealed cluster-specific\naverage alignments that differed from the main average alignment\n(Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 4c\u2013e). Representative genes from different clusters (Fig. 4e) displayed subtle differences in the length and\nposition of matches. Using G2G alignment similarity statistics (Fig. 4f),\nwe identified SGMS2 as the most similar gene (with low log fold change)\nand CCRL2 and C5AR1 as highly dissimilar genes (with high log fold\nchange) between PAM- and LPS-stimulated trajectories. CCRL2 alignment showed a late convergence. We also note TNF as highly dissimilar\n\n**Fig. 5 | Genes2Genes compares cell differentiation trajectories between**\n**healthy lung and disease lung in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.**\n**a, Schematic of the healthy and IPF cell differentiation trajectories of focus, that**\nis, differentiation of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells into alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells in\nthe healthy lung (reference) versus ABCs in the IPF lung (query). b, Aggregate\nalignment over the alignments of all highly variable genes (HVGs) (top).

IPF\nis an incurable and irreversible disease characterized by deposition\nof extracellular matrix by myofibroblasts, scarring and progressive\nloss of lung function, with an estimated survival rate of 3\u20135 years after\ndiagnosis. Using the Adams et al. (2020) dataset, we investigated\nthe differentiation of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells into alveolar type 1\n(AT1) cells in the healthy lung versus AT2 differentiation into aberrant\nbasaloid cells (ABCs) in the IPF lung[,] (Fig. 5a). ABCs have only recently\nbeen characterized in single-cell studies of patients with IPF[,][,][,];\nTheir origin and role in IPF pathogenesis is still unclear.\n\nWe inferred trajectories for healthy and IPF data using diffusion\n\npseudotime (Supplementary Fig. 2) and aligned them using G2G\nacross 994 highly variable genes (under 13 interpolation time points).\nThe alignment distribution (Extended Data Fig. 5a) shows ~62% mean\nsimilarity. As expected, their aggregate alignment showed mismatches\nonly at late pseudotime points (Fig. 5b), given that both healthy and IPF\nlung epithelial differentiation start from AT2 cells, but give rise to AT1\nin healthy versus ABCs in IPF. Moreover, examining the ABC-specific\nmarker genes (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 3), we observe a diverging pattern as reported by other studies[,].\n\nWe performed gene set over-representation analysis on the top\n\nmismatched genes (alignment similarity %40%) and found that epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) was the most significantly enriched\npathway (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 3). While most EMT genes\nshow mismatches only at later stages, consistent with dysregulated\nEMT being implicated in ABC development in IPF[,][\u2013], some EMT\ngenes already show differences at early/mid differentiation stages (for\nexample NNMT, CXCL1 and CXCL8). These could be potential therapeutic targets to prevent differentiation into the pathological ABC state.\n\nDownstream clustering revealed additional alignment pat\nterns (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). For example, cluster 3 represents\nalmost-completely mismatched genes, including upregulation of\n_CAMK1D (Fig. 5e), a known target of TGF-\u03b21 (ref. 36), a key regulator of_\nIPF development. Overall, G2G captured the expected alignments\nand some new early/mid mismatches between the healthy and IPF\ntrajectories.\n\n##### G2G reveals differences of T cell development in vitro\nWe next employed G2G to compare in vitro and in vivo human T cell\ndevelopment. The thymus is the key site for T cell development, where\n\ninterpolated log1p-normalized (per-cell total raw transcript counts normalized\nto 10,000 and log1p-transformed) expression (y axis) against pseudotime\n(x axis) (bottom).

To\ninvestigate human T cell development in a model system in vitro, we\ndifferentiated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells into mature T cells\nusing artificial thymic organoids (ATOs). We previously collected\ndifferentiated cells from week 3, 5 and 7, and reported that the mature\nT cells in ATOs were most similar to in vivo type 1 innate T cells. To\nfurther explore, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of cells collected\nat regular intervals throughout differentiation, including the early\ntime points (Fig. 6a bottom and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Cell types were\nannotated using CellTypist and marker gene analysis (Extended Data\nFigs. 6b\u20138). The ATOs capture differentiation from stem cells, through\nmesodermal progenitors and endothelium to the hematopoietic lineage and then further to the T cell lineage.\n\nWe integrated the ATO cells with the relevant in vivo cells from\n\nour developing human immune atlas (hereafter, \u2018pan fetal reference\u2019) into a common latent embedding using scVI, and estimated\ntheir pseudotime (Extended Data Fig. 6c\u2013e). The ATO pseudotime was\nestimated using a Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM)\nwith sampling times as priors. The pan fetal reference cells\u2019 pseudotime was computed similarly by estimating their time priors from the\nnearby ATO cells.\n\nG2G alignment between the ATO and in vivo trajectories was per\nformed (under 14 interpolation time points) using all transcription factor (TF) genes (1,371 TFs), as many TFs function as \u2018master regulators\u2019\nof cell states and have been used to induce cell differentiation. Their\naggregate alignment showed mismatches at the beginning and at the\nend (Fig. 6b), with ~66% mean alignment similarity in their distribution\n(Extended Data Fig. 9a). Independently, TrAGEDy high-dimensional\nalignment also verified this strong mismatch in early and late stages\nbetween in vitro and in vivo T cell differentiation.\n\n**Clustering alignments finds interesting groups of genes. TF align-**\nments were hierarchically clustered and explored at several resolutions\n(Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). At low resolution (Extended Data Fig. 9c),\ncluster 2 includes pluripotent TFs showing insertions at early pseudotime (Supplementary Table 5). Well-known stemness TFs POU5F1,\n_NANOG and TBX3 (ref. 45) were present in early ATO development, but_\nmissing from the reference. This is expected for pluripotent stem cell\nTFs (Fig. 6c), as in vitro differentiation started from iPS cells, whereas\nthe earliest in vivo cells were hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Among\nthem, HHEX[\u2013] demonstrated another pattern: a match between\nin vivo and in vitro HSCs and DN T cells as expected, although with\nlower maximum HHEX expression in in vitro versus in vivo cells (Fig. 6c).\nNotably, clustering also revealed TF mismatches only at the middle\ntime points (for example POU6F1, SOX18 and CSRNP3 in cluster 0 at\nlow resolution and BATF2 in cluster 13 at high resolution). This might\nrepresent a missing cell state, for example, BATF2 is expressed sparsely\nin endothelial cells, which are present only in the in vitro system. On the\nother hand, LEF1 (necessary for early stages of thymocyte maturation)\n\n**Fig. 6 | Genes2Genes aligns in vivo, in vitro human T cell development.**\n**a, Schematic illustration of T cell development in the human thymus.**\n**b, Aggregate alignment over the alignments of 1,371 TFs between in vitro**\norganoid (ATOs) and in vivo human T cell developmental trajectories, shown in\nthe pairwise time point matrix between organoid and reference.

Gene set over-**\nrepresentation among the most mismatched genes (alignment similarity %40%; Supplementary Table 4) revealed genes associated with TNF\nsignaling via the nuclear factor (NF)-&B pathway. Many of the TFs in\nthis pathway (for example FOSB, JUNB and NR4A2) showed an increasing trend at the last stage of in vivo T cell development, whereas this\nincrease is missing in the in vitro T cells (Fig. 6d). We further validated\nthis by showing that these genes have higher expression in the thymic\nmedulla (where mature T cells reside) than in the cortex (where T cell\nprogenitors reside), to ensure that this is not due to handling artifacts\nof tissue digestion (Supplementary Note). There are exceptions to this\noverall pattern, for example, KLF2, whose expression is higher in vitro\nthan in vivo (Fig. 6d), possibly due to each gene being regulated by more\nthan one signaling pathway. Alignment of all 196 genes in the TNF pathway also confirms a significant mismatch in the last stage (Extended\nData Fig. 10a), suggesting this pathway as a potential target for further\nin vitro optimization. Restricting the analysis to T cell lineages, DN\nstage onwards (Extended Data Fig. 10b, left), TNF signaling via NF-&B\npathway remained the most enriched gene set among the mismatched\nTFs (Supplementary Table 6). We remark that although it is possible to\nrecover these differences via direct DE analysis between cell subsets, for\nexample, end products of ATOs versus in vivo T cells, a key advantage\nof trajectory alignment is the ability to systematically identify the time\npoint where the mismatch occurred during differentiation. This in turn\ninforms us when to introduce TNF in in vitro optimizations.\n\n**In vitro SP T versus in vivo CD8[+] T lineages. The above alignments**\nwere between in vivo type 1 innate T cells and the relevant precursors,\nas we previously found that the in vitro mature T cells were closest to\nthe in vivo type 1 innate T cells; however, in vitro cell differentiation\nto conventional CD8[+] T cells might also provide promising routes for\ncell therapies. We therefore performed another G2G alignment using\nin vivo conventional CD8[+] T cells and the relevant T lineage precursors\n(DN T cells onwards). Differences in the two alignment results suggest that potential targets such as SOX4, FOXP1 and ARID5B may tune\ncells toward in vivo CD8[+] T cells (Supplementary Note, Extended Data\nFig. 10b,c and Supplementary Table 7).\n\n**Preliminary experiment targeting TNF signaling. G2G alignments**\nrevealed potential targets for further optimization of in vitro T cell\ndifferentiation (Fig. 6e). We experimentally validated the impact of\nTNF signaling by adding TNF into the ATO medium between weeks\n6\u20137 (Fig. 6f), and comparing SP T cells of our ATOs (wild-type) and the\n\nthe smoothened (interpolated) and z-normalized mean gene expression along\npseudotime (bottom right). d, Same plots as c for all TFs in the TNF signaling\nvia NF-&B pathway.

We observed that, in the scVI latent space of all in vivo\nand in vitro cells, the Euclidean distance between the mean vectors\nof in vitro SP T cells and the in vivo type 1 innate T cells decreased by\n~5% after TNF treatment. Further examining the effect, TFs and all\ngenes within the TNF signaling pathway (Fig. 6g and Extended Data\nFig. 10d) in T cells showed higher expression in ATOTNF compared to\nATOs, as expected. The mean distance of gene expression distributions also dropped for all genes and TFs that were significantly distant\nbetween ATO T cells and in vivo type 1 innate T cells (Methods and\nSupplementary Note). We note the distance change in several known\nSP T cell maturation markers (IL7R, KLF2, FOXO1, S1PR1 and SELL)[,]\n(Extended Data Fig. 10e,f and Supplementary Fig. 5). IL7R has shown\nto initiate in mature SP thymocytes, with its expression dependent on\nNF-&B signaling[\u2013]. The distance of in vitro and in vivo IL7R expression\nsignificantly dropped after TNF treatment with an increased expression\nas expected from mature T cells. KLF2 was also further upregulated.\nThe rest of the markers maintained expression. Overall, these results\nsuggest more mature SP T cells in ATOTNF.\n\nIt is worth noting that another in vitro T cell differentiation pro\ntocol added TNF throughout differentiation to improve T cell production efficiency[,]; however, G2G identified that the TNF pathway\nmismatches at late T cell differentiation. Therefore, targeting this\npathway, we added TNF in the last week of differentiation to improve\nT cell maturation, which enabled us to successfully push in vitro T cells\nto better match the in vivo T cells (Fig. 6f). Our results suggest that this\nis a potential direction to refine the ATO protocol toward mature type 1\ninnate T cells, subject to future functional validation studies.\n\n### Discussion\nTrajectory alignment can capture transcriptomic similarities and differences of temporal dynamics between cell populations. We developed G2G, a framework to align single-cell pseudotime trajectories\nat single-gene resolution, and demonstrated its utility and versatility\nin single-cell studies (for instance, discerning differential genes or\npathways that drive pathogenicity in diseases or potential targets for\nrefining organoid protocols toward better in vivo recapitulation). G2G\noutperforms existing methods through more descriptive and accurate\nalignments, and our work provides proof of concept of the power of\ngene-level alignment.\n\nGiven cell-by-gene matrices and pseudotime estimates of a\n\nreference and query, G2G generates an alignment for each gene by\nunifying DTW and gap modeling. The distribution of alignments can\ninform gene clusters with broadly similar alignment patterns and\ntheir average alignments. As such aggregated results depend on the\ngenes we choose to align, we recommend selecting genes that are as\ninformative as possible (for example, lineage-relevant driver genes\nor regulons). For instance, we can align the significantly upregulated\nand downregulated genes in the reference to investigate whether the\nquery follows the same dynamics. Aligning TFs can inform differential\nregulation. When aligning all or highly variable genes, we can inspect\ngene clusters (paired with over-representation analysis) to extract\nbiologically meaningful groups, for example, revealing biological or\nsignaling pathways that drive mismatches at different times. These\ncan be a basis for protocol intervention when comparing in vivo or\nin vitro trajectories and for mechanistic molecular interpretation of\ndifferences between any trajectories.\n\nAn important feature of G2G is gene-specific alignment. Most\n\nexisting approaches produce a single alignment by computing\nhigh-dimensional Euclidean distances over all genes. Such metrics\nsuffer from \u2018the curse of dimensionality\u2019 by losing accuracy as the\nnumber of genes increases. A single alignment also masks gene alignment heterogeneity. Alpert et al. recommend aligning the largest gene\nset with significant DE over time, to avoid noise from stably expressed\ngenes Ourmethodgoesfurtherandfullyresolvesallgenegroupswith\n\n\nindividual matching and mismatching patterns at different stages\nof time.\n\nThe reliability of trajectory alignment depends on the quality of\n\ninputs. We recommend selecting a pseudotime inference method\nsuitable for the datasets at hand. One could run G2G with estimates\nfrom different methods and evaluate how robust the results are.\nFuture work is also needed to calibrate trajectory input. For instance,\nan adaptive Gaussian kernel interpolation may optimize the method\u2019s sensitivity to the variance of expression in nearby cells. We also\nrecommend inspecting whether the cell density along pseudotime\nrepresents the entire dynamic process. When there are missing\n(unobserved) cells representing sudden changes, the assumption\nof a smooth trajectory breaks and limits G2G from generating accurate alignments, as the data estimation at each interpolation point is\ncontrolled by the observed cells in its neighborhood. Furthermore,\nG2G only compares two linear trajectories. We are aware of existing\nDTW approaches for branched trajectory alignment. Output pairs\nof correspondences from them could undergo G2G alignment to\ncapture gene-level mismatches.\n\nIn summary, G2G enables deeper understanding of the diver\nsity of gene alignments between single-cell datasets. It is available\n[as an open-source Python package at https://github.com/Teichlab/](https://github.com/Teichlab/Genes2Genes)\n[Genes2Genes. We demonstrated that regenerative medicine can spe-](https://github.com/Teichlab/Genes2Genes)\ncifically benefit from trajectory comparisons by extracting cues to\nguide refinement of in vitro cell engineering. We envision that G2G will\nbe useful to the community for exploring other scenarios such as cell\nactivation or stimulation responses in control and disease, generating\ninsights to advance our understanding of cell development and function in health and disease.\n\n### Online content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information,\nacknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code avail[ability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02378-4.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02378-4)\n\n### References\n1.

It aims to generate an\noptimal sequence of matched and mismatched time points for each\ngene. There are five different alignment states possible between\ntwo reference and query time points (Fig. 1b). For each time point in\nany gene trajectory, there is a respective expression distribution as\nobserved via scRNA-seq measurements. G2G evaluates the distances\nof these distributions in reference and query to infer an optimal gene\nalignment.\n\n##### Pairwise time series alignment for trajectory  comparison\nTrajectory is a continuous path of change through some feature space,\nalong an axis of progression (such as time). In single-cell transcriptomics, this feature space is often defined by genes. A trajectory through a\nhigh-dimensional gene space describes the state of a cell as a function\nof time. The pseudotime of cells represents a discretization of their\ncell-state trajectory. Their genes form a multivariate time series of\nexpression, with each gene as univariate. In this work, we consider\npairwise alignment of univariate time series, which enables gene-level\ntrajectory alignment.\n\nGiven two discrete time series (sequences), reference and query\n_R_\n\nof length (a finite number of time points) and, their pairwise\n_Q_ |R| |Q|\nalignment describes an optimal sequential mapping between their\ntime points. As an optimization problem, this has two key properties:\n(1) an optimal substructure; and (2) overlapping set of subproblems,\nwhich make it solvable by DP. Property (1) means, the optimal alignment of any two prefixes R1\u2025j and Q1\u2025i depends on the optimality of\nthree subalignments: (i) R1\u2025j-1 and Q1\u2025i-1; (ii) R1\u2025j-1 and Q1\u2025i; and (iii) R1\u2025j\nand Q1\u2025i-1. Property (2) means, there exists prefix alignments that are\noverlapping. DP begins optimizing prefix alignment, starting from\nnull ( \u03a6) sequences until it completes aligning the entire two\nsequences. This process computes overlapping subproblems\nonly once and reuses them through a memoization (history) matrix\n\n. In standard DP alignment, stores the optimal alignment\n_Hist_ _Hist(i, j)_\n\ncost of the two prefixes: and, by optimizing an objective func_R1\u2236j_ _Q1\u2236i_\ntion that quantifies the alignment through a set of recurrence relations. Once is computed, the optimal alignment can be retrieved\n_Hist_\nby backtracking, starting from until reaching\n_Hist(|Q| + 1, |R| + 1)_\n\n.\n_Hist(0, 0)_\n\n##### Preprocessing a trajectory time series by distributional interpolation\nInterpolation of time series is necessary to ensure smoothly changing\nand uniformly distributed data (at least approximately). This is because\nnon-interpolated data cannot guarantee a reliable alignment[,]. We\ninterpolate all reference/query gene expression trajectories before\nalignment, by extending CellAlign\u2019s mean-based interpolation method\nto distributional interpolation.\n\nGiven pseudotime series of (log1p-normalized) expression in\n_t_\n\ngene of a single-cell dataset, we first transform the pseudotime axis\n_gj_\nto  range using min\u2013max normalization.\n\nThen, equispaced artificial (interpolation) time points are\n_m_\n\ndefined, and for each interpolation time point, we estimate a Gaussian\n_t\u2032_\ndistribution (of mean and s.d. ) using the Gaussian\n_gj(t[\u2032])mean_ _gj(t\u2032)s.d._\nkernel-based weighted approach. For each cell annotated with pseudotime, a weight is computed with respect to each as:\n_ti_ _t\u2032_\n\n\n_n_\n\nwhere \u2211i=1[g][j][(][t][i][)], is the total number of cells, and is the\n\nexpected weighted cell density at gj_mean = _n_ _n_, that is, \u2211ni=1[w][i], used to account ct\u2032\n\nfor cell abundance when estimating variance (otherwise a very few cells t\u2032 _ct\u2032 =_ _n_\nmay give very high variance). Next, we generated 50 random points\nfrom Gaussian distribution for each, representing\n_N(gj(t\u2032)mean, gj(t\u2032)s.d.)_ _t\u2032_\nthe interpolated distribution of single-cell gene expression. Note that\nwe used a predefined for both reference and query. The interpolation\n_m_\nhas O time complexity due to taking weighted contribution from\n(nm)\nall cells at each . For efficiency, one could subsample datasets and/or\n_t\u2032_\nrestrict the contributing cells to the nearest neighborhood.\n\n**Extreme cases. When the smooth trajectory assumption breaks (for**\nexample, pluripotent genes suddenly dropping to zero mid-way after\nhighly expressed in early development), the interpolated variance\nmight not reflect the true observation. Also, when a gene is (almost)\nzero-expressed, there is no distribution to model. To handle such\nextreme cases when interpolating reference and query gene trajectories, G2G applies the below steps:\n\n  - For either trajectory, check for regions (adjacent interpolation\n\npoints) showing abrupt zero-expression (<3 cells expressed) in\nconsiderable lengths (exceeding 0.2), by sliding-window-scanning; apply a common (10% of the minimum estimated across\n_\u03c3_ _\u03c3_\nall interpolation points) for those regions to have a very low with\n_\u03c3_\nzero mean.\n\n  - If either gene is zero-expressed (<3 cells expressed) across pseu\ndotime, apply 10% of the minimum estimated across all interpola_\u03c3_\ntion points of the other trajectory as the for the extreme-case\n_\u03c3_\ntrajectory and vice versa.\n\n##### A new DP algorithm for gene-level trajectory alignment\nOur DP algorithm is inspired by biological sequence alignment discussed\nin the related literature[\u2013]. It generates an alignment between and\n_R_ _Q_\nexpression time series of a specified gene by adapting Gotoh\u2019s algorithm\nand DTW to accommodate five alignment states (Fig. 1b), that is, one-toone match (M), one-to-many match (V), many-to-one match (W), insertion\n(I) and deletion (D), between a pair of and time points. The five-state\n_R_ _Q_\nspace is denoted by \u2126 = [M, V, W, D, I]. V and W represent warps.\n\nDTW is extensively used to align time series. Sankoff and Kruskal\n\n(1983) previously discussed how to capture both warps and indels\nfrom a single algorithm and provided DP recurrences for evaluating\nall states in \u2126 to assign an optimal state for each pair of and time\n_R_ _Q_\npoints. Extending this further, we implemented Gotoh\u2019s algorithm (of\nO time complexity) to generate an optimal five-state alignment\n(|R||Q|)\nstring for and using:\n_R_ _Q_\n\n - a Bayesian information-theoretic distance measure between two\n\nexpression distributions under the minimum message length\ninference criterion[,].\n\n - a fve-state machine that models state transitions along an\n\nalignment.\n\nThe DP scoring scheme evaluates every pair of time point ( )\n_R_ _j_ _Rj_\n\nand time point ( ) by computing two costs: (1) the cost of matching\n_Q_ _Qi_\nthem (denoted by ) based on their interpolated gene\nCostmatch(i, j)\nexpression distributions, and (2) the cost of assigning an alignment\nstate \u2126 forthem\n\n\nwhere .

See Fig. 2\n_R( j)_ _Q(i)_\n(top left) and Supplementary Fig. 1a for illustrations of our MML\nframework.\n\n_Primer on MML. MML is an inductive inference paradigm for model_\ncomparison and selection, grounded on Bayesian statistics and information theory. Given a hypothesis (model) and data, it lays an\n_H_ _D_\nimaginary message transmission from a sender who jointly encodes\n_H_\nand, for lossless decoding at a recipient\u2019s side. Bayes theorem defines\n_D_\ntheir joint probability as:\n\nPr(H, D) = Pr(H) Pr(D|H) = Pr(D) Pr(H|D)\n\nSeparately, Shannon information ( ) defines the optimal encod_I_\n\ning length of an event with probability as:\n_E_ Pr(E)\n\n_I(E) = \u2212loge(Pr(E))_\n\nmeasured in nits. Applying this to Bayes theorem describes the information needed to encode and jointly as:\n_H_ _D_\n\n_I(H, D) = I(H) + I(D|H)_ (1)\n\nThis gives a two-part total encoding length for and, where\n_H_ _D_ _I(H)_\n\nquantifies the information of, and quantifies the information\n_H_ _I(D|H)_\nof using .

Finally, we have an aggregate five-state alignment string.\n\n**Clustering alignment patterns. We employ agglomerative hierarchi-**\ncal clustering under average linkage criterion (in sklearn v.1.2.2) to\nidentify groups of genes that show similar alignment patterns, given\na pairwise distance matrix between all alignment strings. The distance\nthreshold parameter for the linkage controls where the cluster merge\nstops, allowing inspection of different clustering structures at different\nlevels in the hierarchy.\n\n_Defining a distance measure for five-state alignment strings. Clustering_\nalignments require defining a distance measure between two alignment\npaths. While the polygonal-area-based distance measure works for\nthree-state alignments, it cannot distinguish warps from indels. The\ncommonly used string distance measures are: Levenshtein distance\nand Hamming distance. Levenshtein distance is the minimum number\nof edits (substitutions, inserts and deletes) needed to transform one\nstring to another. G2G computes pairwise Levenshtein distances\nbetween alignment strings (using leven v.1.0.4), normalized by the\nmaximum length of the strings in comparison. Hamming distance is\nthe minimum number of single-character substitutions needed to\ntransform equal-length strings to one another. G2G computes pairwise\nHamming distances using scipy.spatial.distance.cdist (in SciPy v.1.10.1),\nusing the alignment strings encoded as equal-length binary strings (of\nsize ) (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Each alignment string is\n|R| + |Q|\nbinary-encoded by traversing through its alignment path, recording\nfor each and, the match/mismatch state of their respective pseu_R_ _Q_ _x_\ndotime points ( [M, V, W] is encoded by 1; [I, D] is encoded by 0).\n_x \u2208_ _x \u2208_\nThese and binary strings are then concatenated. Note that both\n_R_ _Q_\nLevenshtein and Hamming distances are normalized to range .\n\n_Choosing the right string distance measure. We tested both Levenshtein_\nand Hamming distances. In hierarchical clustering, the number of clusters decreases as the distance threshold increases. Ideally, the bottom\nlevel of an optimal hierarchical clustering of strings shall represent each\nunique string in all strings (that is, the maximum number of clusters at\nthe minimum distance threshold shall be equal to the number of unique\nstrings). When clustering with Levenshtein distance, we observe this\nacross all datasets. Hamming distance, however, does not guarantee\nsuch capture (Supplementary Fig. 6b). This agrees with the theoretical\nexpectation that Levenshtein distance can distinguish all five individual\nstates, whereas Hamming distance can only distinguish matches and\nmismatches. Therefore, we recommend Levenshtein distance for\nalignment clustering.\n\n_Choosing the distance threshold for hierarchical clustering. A common_\nstrategy is to empirically determine the distance threshold based on the\nmean silhouette coefficient (MSC) over all data samples. MSC ranges\n\n[(1,1], where a high positive MSC indicates well-separated clusters, a\nlow positive MSC closer to 0 indicates overlapping clusters, and a low\nnegative MSC indicates incorrect assignments. We obtain clustering for\neligible thresholds in the range [0,1.0] with 0.01 step size, and compute\ntheir MSCs using sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.\n\n_Hierarchical clustering of alignment strings requires a tradeoff. Gen-_\nerally, the best clustering is considered as the one with the highest\nMSC; however, for strings, we observe that this value is given by the\nmaximum possible number of clusters (equal to the number of unique\nalignment strings). In gene-level trajectory alignment, many unique\nalignment patterns can emerge due to subtle differences in their optimal alignment states across pseudotime points. For instance, in our\nsimulated dataset, there are 113 unique strings covering seven alignment patterns (Extended Data Fig 2c) Our objective is a less noisy\n\n\nbiologically interpretable clustering, and we note the importance of\nmanual inspection to decide on a tradeoff between the number of clusters versus cluster resolution. We recommend choosing the distance\nthreshold that provides a good tradeoff between MSC and the number\nof clusters in capturing the main alignment patterns. In our simulated\ndataset, such a tradeoff is given by the threshold 0.22 corresponding to\nthe second highest locally optimal MSC 0.82. This results in 15 clusters,\nincluding the seven major clusters giving only a 0.1% mis-clustering\nrate (the percentage of the number of outliers in all clusters) (Fig. 3e).\nThe rest of the clusters are mini clusters covering 31 (0.8%) alignments\nseparated due to noise such as warps. G2G enables the user to inspect\nthese cluster diagnostics through the distance threshold versus MSC\nplots and the cluster-specific average alignment patterns.\n\n**Pathway over-representation analysis. We select the top** mismatch_k_\ning genes (with %40% alignment similarity) to analyze their biological/\nsignaling pathway over-representation. The identified clusters of genes\nare also analyzed. We use GSEApy (v.1.0.4) Enrichr[,][,] wrapper against\nthe MSigDB_Hallmark_2020 (ref. 66) and KEGG_2021_Human pathway\ngene sets[,]. For all analyses, a 0.05 significance threshold of the\nadjusted P value (computed using the default hypergeometric test and\nBenjamini\u2013Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction of\nGSEApy-enrichr interface) was applied.\n\n##### Determining the best parameter setting\nG2G has several key parameters: interpolation structure, window_size\nof the Gaussian kernel used for interpolation and the five-state machine\nparameters.\n\n**Interpolation structure. The number of equispaced interpolation time**\npoints ( over the  range decide the resolution of a trajectory\n_m)_\nalignment (a higher gives higher resolution).\n_m_\n\nLow resolution can be less representative of the dynamic process,\n\nwhereas high resolution introduces noise or redundancy. The optimal\n\nis a tradeoff that depends on the datasets. We use optBinning\n_m_\n\n(v.0.18.0) to heuristically decide the optimal for reference and query,\n_m_\nseparately. Using ContinuousOptimalBinning, we first infer an optimal\nbinning of the pseudotime distribution and then use the number of\nbins produced as the for our equispaced interpolation. In all datasets\n_m_\nexcept for the T cell datasets, optBinning returned an equal number\nof optimal bins for both reference and query. For T cell datasets, we\nobtained 15 and 14 bins, respectively. For consistency, we selected the\nminimum (14). We do not use the optimal splits returned by optBinning\nas this is an irregular binning structure that is inconsistent for\nalignment.\n\n**Window_size. This controls the effective cell neighborhood toward**\nestimating the weighted mean and variance of expression at each\ninterpolation time point. CellAlign found that 0.1 window_size is the\nmost effective for standard single-cell datasets (with a tradeoff between\nnoise and locality); thus, we use the same across all our experiments\nand analyses.\n\n**Five-state machine. The parameters** (M | M), (I | I) and (M | I)\n\n[Pr Pr Pr\nwere optimized using grid search, while fixing (M | M) = 0.99 to enforce\nPr\nthe highest probability for continuous matches rather than\nsingle-point-matches. [ (I | I) = 0.1, (M | I) = 0.7 yielded the lowest\nPr Pr\nfalse mismatch rate across all G2G alignments on our simulated dataset.\nIt remained optimal when varying (M | M) in [0.1,1.0] (Supplementary\nPr\nTable 2). Therefore we set it as the default. For initial states, we use\n\n[Pr\n(M) = 0.99 and (D) = (I) = 5 ) 10[(5]].\nPr Pr\n\n##### Benchmarking against CellAlign and TrAGEDy alignment\nDTW gene-level and cell-level high-dimensional alignments\nwere generated using CellAlign\u2019s (v 0 1 0) globalAlign function\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowing interpolation and scaling defined in their documentation.\nDTW gene-level alignments were clustered using CellAlign\u2019s pseudotimeClust function. Similarly, TrAGEDy\u2019s post hoc-processed DTW\nalignments were generated using the script published by Laidlaw et al.,\nfollowing documentation. The same number of interpolation time\npoints was used across all CellAlign, TrAGEDy and G2G alignment. Both\nCellAlign and TrAGEDy ran with Euclidean distance for DTW (note that\nTrAGEDy recommends Spearman correlation which is mathematically\nundefined for single-gene observations, thus we use Euclidean distance\nfor both cell-level and gene-level TrAGEDy alignment for consistency).\n\n##### Datasets\n**Datasets for simulated experiments.** _Simulating different alignment_\n_patterns using Gaussian processes. We modeled log-normalized expres-_\nsion of gene as a function of time using a Gaussian process (GP):\n_x_ _f_ _t_\n\n_f(t) \u223c_ _GP(_ _\u03bc\u20d7(t), K(t, t\u2032))_\n\nis the mean vector. is a kernel function evaluating covariance\n_\u03bc_ _K(t, t\u2032)_\n\nof every pair of finite time points, where (t) is evaluated, controlling\n_f_\nthe (t) characteristics (for example, radial basis function (RBF) kernel\n_f_\nfor generating smooth, non-branching functions; a change point kernel\nfor generating branching functions). GP with a suitable kernel can\nsimulate different trajectory patterns in single-cell gene expression\nacross pseudotime. Following the standard textbook and kernels discussed in literature[,], we implemented a simulator using GPyTorch\n(v.1.5.1) for three types of alignment patterns (matching, divergence\nand convergence), comprising 300 cells spread across pseudotime\nrange  for each trajectory.\n\n_Generating a matching pair of reference and query gene trajectories. We_\nused a GP with a constant mean vector ( uniform ran_c_ _\u03bcc\u20d7_ _c \u2208[0.5, 9.0]_\n\ndom sampled) and RBF kernel to sample that describes an average\n_K_ _\u03bc(t)_\nexpression for each time point. Next, we sampled two trajectories:\nand, from a GP with and kernel (\n_GEXref(t)_ _GEXquery(t)_ _\u03bc(t)_ _\u03c3I_ _\u03c3 \u2208[0.05, 1.0]_\nuniform random sampled and = identity matrix).\n_I_\n\n_\u03bc(t) \u223c_ _N( \u20d7\u03bcc, K )_\n\n_GEXref(t) \u223c_ _N( \u03bc(t), \u03c3I )_\n\n_GEXquery(t) \u223c_ _N( \u03bc(t), \u03c3I )_\n\n_Generating a divergence pair of reference and query gene trajectories._\nWe used a change point (CP) kernel, which imposes a bifurcation in a\ntrajectory as it reaches an approximate time point (also called a\n_tCP_\nchange point). It activates one covariance function before and\n_tCP_\nanother after . We used the below CP kernel[,]:\n_tCP_\n\n_KCP(t, t\u2032) = aK1(t, t\u2032) + a\u2032K2(t, t\u2032)_\n\nwhere,\n\n_a = \u03c3(t)\u03c3(t\u2032)_\n\n_a[\u2032]_ = [1 \u2212 _\u03c3 (t)] [1 \u2212_ _\u03c3(t\u2032)]_\n\n\nfrom a separate GP with constant mean vector ( uniform\n_c_ _\u03bcc\u20d7_ _c \u2208[0.5, 9.0]_\n\nrandomly sampled) and an RBF kernel .\n_K_\n\n_\u03bc(t) \u223c_ _N(_ _\u03bcc\u20d7_, K )\n\n_f1(t) \u223c_ _N( \u03bc(t), KCP)_\n\n_f2(t) \u223c_ _N( \u03bc(t), KCP)_\n\n_GEXref(t) \u223c_ _N( f1(t), \u03c3I )_\n\n_GEXquery(t) \u223c_ _N( f2(t), \u03c3I )_\n\n\n1\n_\u03c3(x) =_\n\n1 + exp(\u2212s(x \u2212 _tCP)) [(][sigmoid function][)]_\n\nwith acting as CP steepness parameter.

Following is the\n_K2_ _K2_\ngenerative process starting with a base mean function sampled\n\n\nNext, two functions were sampled from a GP with and CP(t,t\u2019),\n_\u03bc(t)_\n\nwhich were then used as mean vectors to generate and\n_GEXref(t)_\nwith kernel ( = 0.3, a moderate constant). This ran for\n_GEXquery(t)_ _\u03c3I_ _\u03c3_\n\n[ = 0.25, = 0.5 and = 0.75] resulting in three groups of divergence\n_tCP_ _tCP_ _tCP_\nwith varying bifurcation points (early divergence, mid divergence and\nlate divergence). We then filtered the generated pairs to include simple/\nclear divergence patterns (stable ground truth with no complex patterns) using basic heuristics such as the difference between mean\nexpression before divergence and at the end terminals of reference\nand query.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c shows that the branching may start\n\napproximately before CP. Therefore, we expect the early nondivergent\nsegment to continue at least until time point, where we begin to\n_i < tCP_\nsee >0.01 covariance in the CP kernel. Accordingly, given our approx_\nbifurcation_start_point = i, we expect the range of match lengths to fall\nbetween a lower-limit and upper-limit\n_n_total_pseudotime_points \u00d7 i_\n\n.\n_n_total_pseudotime_points \u00d7 change_point_\n\nEquivalently, we expect mismatch lengths to fall between\n\nlower-limit and upper-limit\n_n_total_pseudotime_points \u00d7 (1 \u2212_ _i)_\n\n.\n_n_total_pseudotime_points \u00d7 (1 \u2212_ change_point)\n\n_Generating a convergence pair of reference and query gene trajectories._\nWe simply inverted the above generated divergence pairs, as convergence and divergence are complementary to each other.\n\nThe final dataset comprises 3,500 pairs, covering seven alignment\n\npatterns: 500 matching pairs, 1,500 divergence pairs (500 early + 500\nmid + 500 late) and 1,500 convergence (500 early + 500 mid + 500 late).\n\n##### Simulating mismatches on real scRNA-seq data\nWe downloaded the E15.5 mouse pancreas development dataset from\nthe CellRank package, and subsetted to \u03b2-cell lineage (1,845 cells)\nusing the original author annotations (\u2018Ngn3 low EP\u2019, \u2018Ngn3 high EP\u2019,\n\u2018Fev+\u2019 and \u2018Beta\u2019). We selected the lineage-driver genes that are significantly associated with differentiation potential to \u03b2-cells (769 of 2,000\nhighly variable genes at 1% FDR), using CellRank (v.1.5.1) following their\n[tutorials (https://cellrank.readthedocs.io/en/stable/auto_examples/](https://cellrank.readthedocs.io/en/stable/auto_examples/estimators/compute_lineage_drivers.html)\n[estimators/compute_lineage_drivers.html). For trajectories, we used](https://cellrank.readthedocs.io/en/stable/auto_examples/estimators/compute_lineage_drivers.html)\nthe diffusion pseudotime estimated by the CellRank authors. To simulate trajectories for alignment, we divided the pseudotime (between 0\nand 1) equally into 50 bins, assigned cells to bins based on their pseudotime and randomly split cells into reference and query datasets in\neach bin. To simulate deletions of n bins, we excluded query cells from\nthe first n bins (cells where the pseudotime %nth bin upper margin). To\nsimulate insertions of n bins, we shifted the query cell expression of the\nfirst n bins by the s.d. calculated across all bins for the gene of interest\nin the query cells. Query pseudotime axis was min\u2013max-normalized\nafter perturbation.\n\n##### Datasets for benchmarking G2G\n**Dendritic cell stimulation dataset. The normalized single-cell datasets**\nofPAM/LPSstimulationandtheirpseudotimeestimates(downloaded\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom the CellAlign GitHub repository) were converted into Anndata\nobjects. These contain two gene sets: \u2018core antiviral module\u2019 (99 genes)\nand \u2018peaked inflammatory module\u2019 (89 genes), preselected from the\noriginal publication and referred to as \u2018global\u2019 and \u2018local\u2019, respectively\nby Alpert et al.. The datasets include 179 PAM-stimulated cells and 290\nLPS-stimulated cells. CellAlign used 200 interpolation points for their\nPAM/LPS analysis, whereas the optBinning structure suggests that 14\npoints are sufficient.\n\n**Simulated dataset containing trajectories with no shared process.**\nThis is a simulated negative control, generated using the published\nscript by Laidlaw et al., which uses DynGen, a single-cell data simulator for dynamic processes. This dataset contains two trajectories\nsimulated under two different gene regulatory networks and TF activity, ensuring no shared process between them. The reference and query\nhave 619 genes across 2,000 and 1,940 cells, respectively.\n\n##### Dataset for healthy versus IPF case study\nWe downloaded healthy and IPF datasets from the Gene Expres[sion Omnibus (GEO) (GSE136831) and extracted the lineages AT2 to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136831)\nAT1 cell differentiation for healthy; AT2 to ABC differentiation for\nIPF (based on original author annotations). We identified a subset of\n54 AT2 cells of low quality (with high percentage of ribosomal gene\nexpression) that were filtered out before further analysis. Next, we\nsubsetted healthy and IPF cells to independently preprocess and estimate their pseudotime. This includes 3,157 healthy cells (2,655 AT2\nand 502 AT1) from 28 individuals and 890 IPF cells (442 AT2 and 448\nABCs) from 31 individuals. We first normalized their per-cell total transcript count to 10,000 followed by log1p transformation and selected\n4,000 HVGs to estimate cell pseudotime using Diffusion Pseudotime\nimplemented in SCANPY (v.1.9.6) with default parameter settings.\nThe root cell for each trajectory was chosen based on the expression\nscore of known AT2 progenitor cell markers: AXIN2, FGFR2, ID2, FZD6,\n_LRP5 and LRP6 (refs. 74,75) (using scanpy.tl.score_genes). ABC-specific_\nmarker genes were obtained from the original paper\u2019s supplementary\nfile (aba1983_data_s2.txt).\n\n##### Dataset preparation for in vivo and in vitro T cell development comparison\n**Cell cultures for ATOs and scRNA-seq experiment. The MS5 line**\ntransduced with human DLL4 was obtained from G. Crooks (UCLA)\nas a gift. The MS5-hDLL4 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, 41966)\nwith 10% FBS (Gibco, 16000044). Two iPS cell lines were used in this\nstudy. Cell lines HPSI0114i-kolf_2 (Kolf) and HPSI0514i-fiaj_1 (Fiaj) were\nobtained from the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell initiative\n[(HipSci: www.hipsci.org) collection. All iPS cell lines were cultured](http://www.hipsci.org)\non vitronectin-coated (diluted 1:25 in PBS; Gibco, A14700) plates, in\nTeSR-E8 medium (STEMCELL Technologies, 05990).\n\nWe followed the PSC-ATO protocol as previously described. iPS\n\ncells were collected as a single-cell suspension and seeded (3 ) 10 cells\nper well) in GFR-reduced Matrigel-coated (Corning, 356231) six-well\nplates in X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza, 04-418Q), supplemented with\nrhActivin A, rhBMP4, rhVEGF, rhFGF (R&D Systems, 338-AC-010/314-BP010/298-VS-005/233-FB-010) and ROCK inhibitor (Y27632; LKT Labs,\nY1000) on day (17 and only rhBMP4, rhVEGF and rhFGF on days (16\nand (15. Cells were collected 3.5 days later (day (14) and isolated\nby fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for CD326[\u2013]CD56[+] (PE\nanti-human CD326 antibody, BioLegend, 324205; APC anti-human\nCD56 antibody, BioLegend, 318309) human embryonic mesodermal\nprogenitors (hEMPs). Representative FACS plots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a.\n\nIsolated hEMPs were combined with MS5-hDLL4 at a ratio of 1:50.\n\nTwo or three cell-dense droplets (5 ) 10 cells in 6 \u00b5l hematopoietic\ninduction medium) were deposited on top of an insert in each well of\nasix-wellplate HematopoieticinductionmediumcomposedofEGM2\n\n\n(Lonza, CC-3162) supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and SB blocker\n(TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase inhibitor SB- 431542; Abcam, ab120163) was\nadded into the wells outside the inserts so that the cells sat at the air\u2013liquid interface. The organoids were then cultured in EGM2 with SB blocker\nfor 7 days (days (14 to (7), before the addition of cytokines rhSCF,\nrhFLT3L and rhTPO (Peprotech, 300-07/ 300-19/300-18) between days\n(6 to 0. These 2 weeks formed the hematopoietic induction phase.\nOn day 1, the medium was changed again to RB27 (RPMI (Corning,\n10-040-CV) supplemented with B27 (Gibco, 17504-044), ascorbic acid\n(Sigma-Aldrich, A8960-5G), penicillin\u2013streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich,\nP4333) and glutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050061)) with\nrhSCF, rhFLT3L and rhIL7 (Peprotech, 200-07). The organoids can be\nmaintained in culture for 7 more weeks in this medium.\n\nFor dissociation of organoids on day (7, they were removed from\n\nculture insert and incubated in digestion buffer, which consisted of\ncollagenase type IV solution (STEMCELL Technologies, 07909) supplemented with 0.88 mg ml[(1] collagenase/dispase (Roche, 10269638001)\nand 50 U DNase I (Sigma, 9003-98-9 D5025-15KU), for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C.\nVigorous pipetting was performed in the middle of the incubation and\nat the end. After complete disaggregation, a single-cell suspension was\nprepared by passing through a 50-\u00b5m strainer.\n\nFor dissociation of organoids from day 0 onwards, a cell scraper\n\nwas used to detach ATOs from cell culture insert membranes and\ndetached ATOs were then submerged in cold flow buffer (PBS (Gibco,\n14190144) containing 2% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM EDTA (Invitrogen,\n15575020)). Culture inserts were washed and detached ATOs were\npipetted up and down to form a single-cell suspension before passing\nthrough a 50-\u00b5m strainer.\n\nCells were then stained with designed panels of antibodies and ana\nlyzed by flow cytometry. FACS was performed at the same time and live\nhuman 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)[(] anti-mouse CD29[\u2013] (Invitrogen, D1306; APC/Cy7 anti-mouse CD29 antibody, BioLegend, 102225)\ncells were sorted for day (7, day 0 and week 3 samples, and live (DAPI[\u2013])\ncells were sorted for week 5 and week 7 samples before loading onto\neach channel of a Chromium chip from a Chromium single-cell V(D)J kit\n(10X Genomics). Representative FACS plots are shown in Supplementary\nFig. 7b. The metadata for all the ATO samples can be found in Supplementary Table 8. For the day (14 sample, some sorted (both hEMP and the\nrest of the DAPI[\u2013] fraction) and unsorted cells were stained with hashtag\nantibodies (TotalSeq-C antibodies from BioLegend (Supplementary\nTable 9), following a 10x cell surface protein-labeling protocol) before\nbeing mixed together with some mouse stromal cells (MS5-hDLL4) for\n10x loading. For week 1 sample, hashtag antibodies were added at the\nsame time as the FACS antibodies, before sorting. All antibodies used\nwere added as 2 \u00b5l per antibody in a total of 100 \u00b5l staining solution.\n\nSingle-cell complementary DNA synthesis, amplification and gene\n\nexpression (GEX) and cell surface protein (CITE-seq) libraries were\ngenerated following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sequencing was\nperformed on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 system. The gene expression\nlibraries were sequenced at a target depth of 50,000 reads per cell using\nthe following parameters: Read1: 26 cycles; i7, 8 cycles; i5, 0 cycles;\nRead2: 91 cycles to generate 75-bp paired-end reads.\n\n**ATO data preprocessing and annotation. Raw scRNA-seq reads were**\nmapped using Cell Ranger (v.3.0.2) with combined human reference\nof GRCh38.93 and mouse reference of mm10-3.1.0. Low-quality cells\nwere filtered out (minimum number of reads of 2,000, minimum number of genes of 500, maximum number of genes of 7,000; Scrublet\n(v.0.2.3) doublet detection score <0.15 and mitochondrial reads fraction <0.2). Cells where the percentage of counts from human genes was\n<90% were considered as mouse cells and excluded from downstream\nanalysis. Cells were assigned to different cell lines (Kolf or Fiaj) using\ngenotype prediction with Souporcell (v.2.4.0). The mapping outputs\nof the eight samples were merged, with sample ID prepended to the\nbarcode IDs in both the BAM and barcodes tsv to prevent erroneous\n\n\n-----\n\ncross-sample barcode overlap. Souporcell was run with \u2013skip_remap\nTrue \u2013-K 2 and the common variants file based on common (*2%\npopulation allele frequency) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\nfrom 1000 Genomes Project data, as distributed in the tool\u2019s repository. We selected two clusters due to the already known two cell lines.\nNext the data went through the standard pipeline of filtering out genes\n(cell cycle genes, genes detected in <3 cells) and normalizing the\nper-cell total count to 10,000 followed by log1p transformation and\nscaling to zero mean and unit variance (with max_value = 10 to clip after\nscaling), using SCANPY. The final dataset had 31,483 ATO cells with\n23,526 genes, which were input to CellTypist (v.0.1.4) (for annotation\nprediction using pretrained logistic regression classifier \u2013Pan_Fetal_\nHuman model under majority voting). We then obtained the Uniform\nManifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding for this\ndataset based on its scVI (v.0.14.5) batch-corrected embedding (with\nten latent dimensions, two hidden layers, 128 nodes per hidden layer\nand 0.2 dropout rate for the neural network) and subsetted cells to\nnon-hematopoietic lineage, T/ILC/NK lineage and other hematopoietic lineage cells (Extended Data Fig. 8) using Leiden clustering. For\neach lineage, scVI and UMAP embeddings were re-computed and cell\ntypes were annotated (low-level annotations in Extended Data Fig. 6b,\nwith more refined annotations in Extended Data Fig. 7a) by inspecting\nboth CellTypist predictions (Extended Data Fig. 7b) and marker gene\nexpression (Extended Data Fig. 8).\n\n**Joint embedding of reference and organoid for pseudotime esti-**\n**mation. We downloaded the annotated human fetal atlas dataset**\n[from https://developmental.cellatlas.io/fetal-immune and extracted](https://developmental.cellatlas.io/fetal-immune)\ncell types (79,535 cells in total) representing the T cell developmental trajectory from progenitor cells toward type 1 innate T cells (T1\ndataset), including cycling MPP, HSC_MPP, LMPP_MLP, DN(early) T,\nDN(P) T, DN(Q) T, DP(P) T, DP(Q) T, ABT(entry) and type 1 innate T cells.\nWe then compiled a reduced representation (20,384 cells), preserving their underlying cell-type composition by random subsampling\nfrom each cell type (with minimum sample size of 500 cells, aiming\nfor ~20,000 total number of cells) based on their annotations. Such\nstratified-sampling is practical for dealing with massive single-cell datasets to reduce resource demands. Separately, we extracted cell types\nfrom the ATO dataset (19,013 cells) representing the trajectory from iPS\ncells toward SP T cells, including iPS cells, primitive streak, mesodermal progenitor, endothelium, HSC_MPP, HSC_MPP/LMPP_MLP/DC2,\nDN(early) T, DN T, DP(P) T, DP(Q) T, ABT(entry) and SP T cells.\n\nT1 and ATO datasets were merged and preprocessed together by\n\nfiltering out cells with more than 8% total mitochondrial unique molecular identifiers, cell cycle genes and genes expressed in <3 cells. Next,\nHVGs were selected after normalizing per-cell count to 10,000 reads\nand log1p transformation. T1 pan fetal reference had 33 batches (due\nto different 10x chemistry 3+ versus 5+ and donors), whereas the ATOs\nhad two batches (due to two cell lines, Kolf and Fiaj). We constructed\na batch-corrected, scVI latent embedding (ten latent dimensions, two\nhidden layers, 128 nodes per hidden layer and 0.2 dropout rate for the\nneural network) of the merged dataset. This was taken to build the cell\nneighborhood graph and UMAP embedding using SCANPY. The final\nT1 and ATO datasets comprised 20,327 cells and 17,176 cells respectively.\nA total of 18,436 cells of T1 and 10,089 cells of ATO belong to the T cell\nlineage (DN T onwards).\n\nWe followed a similar preprocessing for the pan fetal reference\n\nrepresenting the trajectory toward CD8[+] T (CD8[+] dataset) (including\ncycling MPP, HSC_MPP, LMPP_MLP, DN(early) T, DN(P) T, DN(Q) T,\nDP(P) T, DP(Q) T, ABT(entry) and CD8[+] T cells). The initially extracted\nCD8[+] subset (83,177 cells) was reduced to 20,412 cells, which was then\nmerged with the 19,013 ATO cells and subjected to the same filtering\nand normalization carried out for the T1 + ATO merge before scVI\nintegration. The final CD8[+] dataset comprised 20,324 cells, of which\n18 490 cells were DN T onwards\n\n\n**Pseudotime estimation using GPLVM. Differentiation pseudotime**\nwas estimated separately for T1 reference, CD8[+] reference and ATO by\nemploying GPLVM[,] (a probabilistic nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that models gene expression as a function of a set of\n_f(X)_\nlatent covariates X). It enables incorporating time priors when estimating pseudotime as a latent dimension. GPLVM has previously been\nsuccessful in single-cell trajectory inference to incorporate useful\npriors[\u2013] We used the Pyro (v.1.8.0) GPLVM implementation with\nsparse GP inference (32 inducing points), RBF and Adam optimizer, to\nobtain an optimal two-dimensional latent embedding, where the two\ndimensions correspond to pseudotime and a second level of latent\neffects (for example batch), respectively. The pseudotime was assigned\na Gaussian prior with cell sampling times as the mean. The second\ndimension was zero-initialized. GPLVM loss curve reasonably converged in 2,000 iterations at optimization.\n\nFor the ATO data, GPLVM was initialized with cell sampling (cap\nture) days as the prior. As there was no temporal data for the pan fetal\nreference, we first approximated time prior for each reference cell as\nthe weighted average of their k-nearest organoid neighborhood (kNN)\ncapture time. A k = 3 organoid neighborhood for a reference cell was\nobtained using the cKDTree-based search method implemented in\nBBKNN (v.1.5.1) on their scVI-based UMAP embedding. Contribution\nof each organoid neighbor was weighted according to its distance (the\n_kNN distance vector was softmax-transformed and the normalized recip-_\nrocal of each distance was taken as the associated weight, enforcing less\ncontribution from distant neighbors toward the weighted average). This\napproximation may introduce outliers due to the spatial arrangement of\ndifferent cell types in the UMAP. Thus, we leveraged the known cell-type\nannotations to refine the approximation by assigning each reference\ncell with the average approximated capture time of its cell type. These\napproximated capture times were scaled to be in  range and input as\nthe mean of the Gaussian prior of pseudotime to the previously described\nGPLVM. For T1 and CD8[+] GPLVMs, the input gene space was 2,608 genes\nand 2,616 genes, respectively (the same as at scVI integration). To ensure\nno outliers, the GPLVM estimated pseudotime was further refined by correcting outliers of each cell type using the cell-type specific average of\nestimated pseudotime. Outliers were selected based on the interquartile\nrange (IQR) rule (1.5 ) IQR below the first quartile and above the third\nquartile of the cell-type-specific pseudotime distribution).\n\n##### G2G alignment\nFor the complete T1 versus ATO comparison using G2G, the total common gene space of 20,240 genes was considered upon filtering genes\nwith <3 cells expressed, 10,000 total count per-cell normalization and\nlog1p transformation. For the DN T onwards comparison, there were\n17,718 genes for T1 versus ATO and 20,183 genes for CD8[+] versus ATO.\nThese total gene spaces were subsetted to include only the transcription factors (1,371 TFs) and relevant signaling pathways focused in\nthis work. G2G alignment was performed using 14 equispaced pseudotime points.\n\n**High-dimensional alignment using CellAlign and TrAGEDy. To**\ncompare G2G alignment of T1 versus ATO against CellAlign and TrAGEDy alignments, we followed the same steps and parameter settings of\nthose tools as described in the previous section \u2018Benchmarking against\nCellAlign and TrAGEDy alignment\u2019. The alignment of 14 equispaced\ninterpolation pseudotime points across the 1,371 TFs gave a three-state\nalignment string (MVVVVVVMWMWWWVWWWMWVVVWW) from CellAlign and\na five-state alignment string (IIIIIIMMMWWWWMWWMIDIDID) from\nTrAGEDy.\n\n##### ATO TNF preliminary validation experiment\nFor the TNF validation experiment, we followed the PSC-ATO protocol described previously using Kolf iPS cell line. One plate (12 organoids)wassetforeachcondition withfourTNF(R&DSystems 210-TA)\n\n\n-----\n\nconditions: control (no TNF addition), 1 ng ml[(1] (final concentration),\n5 ng ml[(1] and 25 ng ml[(1]. TNF was added into the medium between weeks\n6\u20137. Organoids were collected at week 7, stained with hashtag antibodies (TotalSeq-C antibodies from BioLegend) and a designed panel of\nFACS antibodies and sorted for DAPI[\u2013]CD45[+] cells before 10x loading.\nRepresentative FACS plots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7c. Library\nconstruction, sequencing and data preprocessing was the same as the\nWT ATO organoids.\n\n##### Assessing T cells from ATO before and ATO after TNF treatment\nThe ATOs with TNF treatment (ATOTNF) resulted in 123 good quality\nT cells (data preprocessing and filtering as above; annotated by CellTypist as type 1 innate T cells) where the majority (~94% cells) were\n1 ng ml[(1] TNF-treated (as opposed to wild-type, 5 ng ml[(1] and 25 ng ml[(1]).\nThus, we performed the analysis using T cells treated with 1 ng ml[(1] TNF\n(116 cells) that were predicted to be type 1 innate T cells by CellTypist.\n\nThe wild-type ATOs without TNF treatment have 6,558 SP T cells\n\nand the pan fetal reference39 has 1,413 type 1 innate T cells. To check\nwhether there is an improvement in the maturity of resultant T cells in\nATOTNF, we evaluated and compared the degree of similarity between\nATOTNF and the reference against that between ATOs and the reference.\nThis assessment was conducted via two directions: cell level and gene\nlevel. For cell-level assessment, we constructed an scVI latent embedding by integrating the reference, ATOs and ATOTNF together, following\nthe same preprocessing steps carried out for the ATOs and the reference\npreviously. We then computed the Euclidean distance between the mean\nlatent dimensions of in vitro SP T cells and in vivo type 1 innate T cells. For\ngene-level assessment, we computed the MML distance of gene expression distributions by first identifying significantly distant genes across\nall the TFs, as well as across several curated pathway gene subsets from\nKEGG and MSigDB that are associated with TNF signaling (Supplementary Note), before and after TNF treatment. We next tested whether the\ndifference between those distance distributions was significant or not\nusing the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. The following section describes our\napproach to identifying genes with a statistically significant distance.\n\n##### Estimating an empirical null distribution of MML distances to assess significance of a distance\nWe expect no significant difference in gene expression between any\ntwo random subsets of cells belonging to the same cell type in the same\nsystem. Thus, we generated such random pairs of cell subsets within\nour pan fetal reference (type 1 innate T cell) dataset as well as within\nthe ATO (SP T cell) dataset across all 1,371 TFs, to construct an empirical\nnull distribution for MML distance. This enables us to compute a P value\nfor any given MML distance, indicating how likely is to occur by\n_x_ _x_\nchance.\n\nFor each TF, we performed uniform random sampling of a subset\n\npair without replacement for 50 iterations, resulting in 137,100 total\nnumber of pairs. Each subset contains 50 cells. Then, for each pair, we\ncomputed the MML distance. All computed MML distances together\nform a null distribution which we used to evaluate significance of a\ngiven MML distance between two expression distributions.\n\nThe resultant empirical distribution of MML distances is highly\n\nleft-skewed. We constructed its empirical cumulative density function (CDF) using distributions.empirical_distribution.ECDF function\nin statsmodels (v.0.13.5) to test significance in distances under no\nassumption about the family of distribution. The P values were adjusted\nfor multiple testing using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method, before\nidentifying significantly distant genes at a given level of significance.\n\n##### Testing statistical significance of the change in gene expression distances to reference from wild-type ATOs versus ATOTNF\nGiven the MML distances of the genes that are significantly different: (1) between the reference and ATOs (sample 1); and (2) between\n\n\nthe reference and ATOTNF (sample 2), we tested whether the average\ngene expression distance dropped after TNF treatment. To test the\nsignificance of the change in distance, we performed a nonparametric\nMann\u2013Whitney U-test implemented in scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu.\n\n##### Testing the closeness of SP T cells in the ATO to the reference type 1 innate T cells before and after TNF treatment\nWe compared the 6,558 SP T cells in ATO and the 116 T cells in ATOTNF,\nagainst the 1,413 type 1 innate T cells from the pan fetal reference. This\nwas carried out for all 1,371 human TFs, as well as the 196 genes in TNF\nsignaling via the NF-&B pathway (from MSigDb).\n\nFor each gene set, we first computed the MML distances of the\n\ngenes between (1) reference and ATOs; and (2) reference and ATOTNF.\nWe then computed a P value for each MML distance under the empirical CDF estimated by computing MML distances between randomly\nsampled homogeneous subsets across the reference and ATO cells.\nThis allowed us to identify the gene set that was significantly different\nbetween reference and ATOs (diffsetUNTREATED) and the gene set that was\nsignificantly different between reference and ATOTNF (diffsetTREATED).\nNext, we compared the average distance of genes in diffsetUNTREATED\nto the average distance of genes in diffsetTREATED, while testing the significance of the change in the distances using Mann\u2013Whitney U-test.\n\n##### Software and computational requirements\nThe G2G framework and all analyses were implemented in Python\n(*v.3.8) with commonly used scientific-computing and visualization\nlibraries and the specific libraries mentioned in the Methods. G2G\nwas tested on two operating systems: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS and Debian\nGNU/Linux 10 (buster). The G2G runtime depends on the number of\ncells in the reference and query datasets, the number of interpolation\ntime points and the number of genes to align. G2G (v.0.1.0) used in\nthis work is a less-efficient version that utilizes concurrency through\nPython multiprocessing to speed up the gene-level alignment process.\nIt creates a number of processes equal to the number of cores in the\nsystem and each process performs a single gene-level alignment at one\ntime. Per-gene runtime for a case aligning 100 genes between 20,327\nreference cells and 17,176 query cells (pan fetal reference and ATO\ndatasets), with 14 interpolation points and 16 cores in a Linux (SMP\nDebian 4.19.304-1 (2024-01-09)) system, was approximately 5.57 s.\nA notably faster, latest Genes2Genes v.0.2.0 is now available, running sequentially with 0.60 s per-gene for the same case (SMP Debian\n5.10.216-1 (2024-05-03)).\n\n##### Reporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n### Data availability\nData used to perform analyses in the manuscript are available at\n[https://zenodo.org/records/11182400 (ref. 86) and https://github.](https://zenodo.org/records/11182400)\n[com/Teichlab/G2G_notebooks.

Introduction**\n\nSince the introduction of DNA sequencing technologies and genomic diagnostics,\n\nincreasing insights have been given into the evolution and variability of genomes. Over the\npast few decades, changes in the nucleotide composition and structure have been observed\nand extensively studied in a variety of organisms. A common observation when comparing\ngenomes over time, across individuals or in different cell types is alterations of a single or\nmultiple nucleotides. In many studies, observations of these alterations, termed genomic\nvariants, have been associated with diseases, evolutionary processes and biodiversity .\nThe perceived benefits of a comprehensive understanding of genomic variants have driven\nimmense efforts to collect and analyze genomic data. A range of bioinformatics software\nprograms have been released to accurately quantify and describe the characteristics of\ngenomic variants in a single or multiple genomes . For such a software product to prevail\nover time, it is often subject to long-term update cycles, compared to novel competing\nsoftware in the field and analyzed for technical errors by the community. These challenges\nof continuous software development require robust testing and the evaluation of results .\nIn the context of genomic variant detection, bioinformatics software needs to perform well\nunder a variety of technical setups and the set of reported genomic variants should comply\nwith a known ground truth.\n\nSeveral existing applications provide functionalities for the performance of individual\n\nsteps towards the end-to-end testing of genomic variant detection. Mason  and ART \nare applications used to generate synthetic sequencing data for different sequencing technologies. PICARD  and BCFtools  are established tool suites for the manipulation of\nhigh-throughput sequencing data and variant call format (VCF) files. Krusche et al. \nproposed a framework describing best practices for the benchmarking of small germline\nvariants, which led to the highly recognized precisionFDA challenge . The same authors\nreleased the widely community-accepted hap.py tools for variant set comparison. This\n\n\n-----\n\n_Viruses 2024, 16, 1444_ 2 of 7\n\ntool suite implements elaborate methods to address complex cases where representational\ndifferences between sets of variants cannot be trivially fixed. A commonly used alternative\n[to hap.py is RTG Tools (https://github.com/RealTimeGenomics/rtg-tools, accessed on](https://github.com/RealTimeGenomics/rtg-tools)\n3 September 2024). Vcfdist  is another evaluation tool with a focus on using local\nphasing information. The recent NCbench  is an elaborate benchmark platform for sets\nof small genomic variants. It has a competitive advantage in interactivity and visualization.\nHowever, none of these individual applications offers an all-in-one solution for flexible,\non-demand and easy-to-install end-to-end testing in genomic variant detection.\n\nTo this end, we introduce CIEVaD (an abbreviation for Continuous Integration and\n\nEvaluation of Variant Detection), a lightweight workflow collection designed for the rapid\ngeneration of synthetic test data from haploid reference genomes and the validation of\nsoftware for genomic variant detection. CIEVaD is implemented in Nextflow , a\nworkflow management framework for streamlined and reproducible data processing.\nThe use of Nextflow additionally avoids manual installation efforts for the user via the\ndeployment of software packages. CIEVaD is open-source and freely available on Github\n[at https://github.com/rki-mf1/cievad (accessed on 3 September 2024).](https://github.com/rki-mf1/cievad)\n\n**2. Materials and Methods**\n\nThe CIEVaD workflow collection contains two main workflows. The haplotype work\nflow generates synthetic data, whereas the evaluation workflow examines the accordance\nbetween sets of genomic variants. In the following, the term synthetic is used synonymously\nfor in silico-generated data.\n\n_2.1. Haplotype Workflow_\n\nThe haplotype workflow provides a framework for data generation. Synthetic data\n\ncan be used for genomic variant calling, and the data generation scales computationally to\nmany individuals. Moreover, different types of sequencing data can be specified. To begin\nwith data generation, the one input parameter strictly required by the user is a reference\ngenome. With only a given reference genome, the haplotype workflow generates a new\nhaplotype sequence of the entire reference genome, a set of synthetic genomic variants\n(henceforth referred to as a truthset) and synthetic genomic reads. The truthset comprises\nsingle-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) of, at most,\n20 nucleotides. The maximum length of indels, as well as the frequency of both variant\ntypes, can be adjusted via the workflow parameters. Since the variants of the truthset are\nhomozygous, the alternative\u2013allele ratio for each variant is defined as 1 \u2192 _\u03f5, where \u03f5 is_\ndrawn from the read-specific error distribution.\n\nIn the initial step, the workflow indexes the given reference genome. Next, CIEVaD\n\nuses the Mason variator  for a given number n of individuals (the default is n = 3). The\nresult of this step is a haplotype sequence and truthset per individual. Here, a haplotype\nsequence is a copy of the reference genome with small genomic variants of the truthset\ninserted at pseudo-random locations. In other terms, the reference genome and a haplotype\nsequence differ in the variants of the corresponding truthset. The final step is the generation\nof synthetic genomic reads. Depending on the specified type of sequencing data (the default\nis NGS), either the Mason simulator generates pairs of genomic reads or PBSIM3 \ngenerates a set of synthetic long reads. The read simulation parameters can be tuned via\nCIEVaD\u2019s command-line interface or via a configuration file. In both cases, the workflow\nreturns the alignment of the reads to the reference genome, e.g., for the manual inspection\nof the genomic variants and sequencing artifacts in the reads. Note that the data of\neach individual are computed in asynchronous parallel Nextflow processes, which scale\neffortlessly with additional CPU threads or compute nodes.\n\n_2.2. Evaluation Workflow_\n\nThe objective of the evaluation workflow is to assess how successfully a third-party\n\ntool or workflow detects genomic variants. To assess the detection, CIEVaD\u2019s evaluation\n\n\n-----\n\n_Viruses 2024, 16, 1444_ 3 of 7\n\nworkflow compares the set of genomic variants generated by the third-party tool or workflow (such a set is further referred to as a callset) with the corresponding truthset. The only\nstrictly required input for the evaluation workflow is a set of callsets in the variant call\nformat (VCF), either given as a folder path or a sample sheet. The outputs are reports about\nthe accordance between corresponding truth- and callsets.\n\nThe evaluation workflow consists of only two consecutive steps. First, the open-source\n\ntool suite hap.py by Illumina Inc. is used to compare all truthsets with their corresponding\ncallsets. In fact, its included submodule som.py identifies the number of correctly detected\n(TP), missed (FN), and erroneously detected (FP) variants. Due to using som.py, this comparison of the variants neglects the genotype information and only checks their positions\nin the genome, as well as the nucleotide composition. This default behavior is chosen since\nCIEVaD was initially developed for haploid pathogens where the presence of a variant\nitself reflects the genotype. Using the TP, FP, and FN counts, som.py reports the precision,\nrecall, and F1-score of the variant detection process that yields the callset. The second step\nof the evaluation workflow is the computation of the average scores across the statistics of\nall individuals.\n\n**3. Results**\n\nTo demonstrate the utility of CIEVaD, we implemented end-to-end tests (Appendix A\n\nFigure A1) for different variant detection software programs as part of their continuous\nintegration frameworks.\n\n_3.1. Assessing Variant Detection from NGS Data as Part of SARS-CoV-2 Genome Reconstruction_\n\nWe deployed CIEVaD to benchmark the variant detection routine within CoVpipe2 .\n\nCoVpipe2 is a computational workflow for the reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.\nOne sub-process of CoVpipe2 applies the FreeBayes  variant detection method to a\nset of reference-aligned NGS reads. We implemented a test as part of CoVpipe2\u2019s Github\n[Actions (https://github.com/rki-mf1/CoVpipe2/actions/workflows/VariantCalling.yml,](https://github.com/rki-mf1/CoVpipe2/actions/workflows/VariantCalling.yml)\naccessed on 3 September 2024) with the objective of obtaining F1-scores for the detection of\nSNVs and indels. The test consists of seven principal steps:\n\n1. Install Conda and Nextflow;\n\n2. Download a reference genome;\n\n3. Run CIEVaD hap.nf;\n\n4. Run CoVpipe2;\n\n5. Prepare input for CIEVaD eval.nf;\n\n6. Run CIEVaD eval.nf;\n\n7. Check results.\n\nIn brief, the test runs the CIEVaD haplotype workflow with the default parameters,\n\nCoVpipe2 with the generated synthetic NGS data, and the CIEVaD evaluation workflow\nwith the filtered callsets from CoVpipe2 and finally checks whether the F1-scores of the\nSNV and indel detection have decreased compared to the previous test scores. This rapid\ndeployment of CIEVaD (v0.4.1) benchmarks the variant callsets of CoVpipe2 (v0.5.2) with\nF1-scores of 0.97 and 0.91 for SNVs and indels, respectively. The full table of results for this\nevaluation is given in Appendix B Table A1.\n\n_3.2. Assessing Variant Detection from Long-Read Data as Part of Nanopore Sequencing_\n_Data Analysis_\n\nIn order to deploy CIEVaD for a different genomic data type, we generated long reads\n\nwith hap.nf using the \u2013read_type parameter (see Supplementary Material A). The read\ntype parameter invokes additional default parameters of the haplotype workflow that\nare tailored to a high-coverage long-read WGS experiment on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.\nWith this setup, the haplotype workflow and its internal long-read module  generate\na dataset with an average of 500-fold read coverage, per base accuracy of approximately\n90% (Appendix C Figure A2), and an error distribution model trained on genomic data\n\n\n-----\n\n_Viruses 2024, 16, 1444_ 4 of 7\n\nfrom Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We used the synthetic long-read dataset and the\nground truth variants to test the variant detection of the poreCov  data analysis pipeline.\nSupplementary Material A shows how we adjusted poreCov (v1.9.4) to process the synthetic\nlong-read dataset and, subsequently, how the evaluation workflow of CIEVaD verified\nporeCov\u2019s results. Our evaluation of poreCov (Appendix D Table A2) shows F1-scores of\n0.95 and 0.73 for SNVs and indels, respectively.\n\n**4. Conclusions**\n\nWe introduce CIEVaD, an easy-to-apply tool suite used to assess small variant de\ntection from short- and long-read datasets. CIEVaD is modular, extensible, and scaleable;\nrequires no manual installation of internal software; and operates entirely on standard\nbioinformatics file formats. We show that the workflows of CIEVaD enable the rapid\ndeployment of end-to-end tests, including the generation of synthetic genomic data and the\nevaluation of results from third-party variant detection software. Our tool greatly benefits\nbioinformaticians and data scientists in genomics by reducing the time spent on routine\ntasks for the evaluation and reporting of variant detection.\n\nWith the workflow design, open-source policy, file formats, software packaging, and\n\ndocumentation, we aim to comply with the PHA4GE best practices for public health\n[pipelines (https://github.com/pha4ge/public-health-pipeline-best-practices/blob/main/](https://github.com/pha4ge/public-health-pipeline-best-practices/blob/main/docs/pipeline-best-practices.md)\n[docs/pipeline-best-practices.md, accessed on 3 September 2024). Within the scope of this](https://github.com/pha4ge/public-health-pipeline-best-practices/blob/main/docs/pipeline-best-practices.md)\nwork, we did not implement advanced continuous integration strategies for third-party\nsoftware, but it is up to the user to apply arithmetic operations or use test frameworks\naround the results of CIEVaD. It should be mentioned here that CIEVaD is not restricted\nto synthetic data; the evaluation workflow also works with curated variant callsets from\nreal sequencing data. Moreover, CIEVaD evaluates all variants reported within the VCF\nfile, irrespective of their allele ratios (e.g., low-abundance variants in cases of intrahost\nvariation). For the generation of synthetic read data, we chose to integrate the Mason\nand PBSIM3 read simulators due to their computational performance, maintenance status,\nand availability. The current limitations of CIEVaD comprise the ploidy of the provided\nreference genome and the types of variants. As the project and workflows were initially\nintended for viral pathogens, we have not implemented an option to generate diploid\ngenomes and, hence, heterozygous variants. For the same reason, we have not provided\nan option to generate synthetic structural variants. In addition, structural variants require\nmore sophisticated algorithms for variant set comparison. The features for heterozygous\nand structural variants remain subject to the users\u2019 demands. Finally, although CIEVaD\nand its utility were demonstrated solely on software for SARS-CoV-2 data, there is no\ntechnical limitation regarding the usage of CIEVaD for SARS-CoV-2. We expect CIEVaD to\nwork seamlessly with workflows tailored to other pathogens, e.g., RSVpipe , and even\nworkflows that are not pathogen-specific, e.g., viralrecon (10.5281/zenodo.3901628) from\nthe nf-core framework .\n\n**[Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v16091444/s1)**\n\n[//www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v16091444/s1.](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v16091444/s1)\n\n**Author Contributions: T.K. implemented CIEVaD and the tests of the third-party software.

Here, we integrate targeted and bulk RNA sequencing (N = 2238 samples) to track the viral, bacterial, and functional content over geospatially distinct areas within Miami Dade County, USA, from 2020-2022. We used targeted amplicon sequencing to track diverse SARS-CoV- 2 variants across space and time, and we found a tight correspondence with positive PCR tests from University students and Miami-Dade hospital patients. Additionally, in bulk metatranscriptomic data, we demonstrate that the bac- terial content of different wastewater sampling locations serving small popu- lation sizes can be used to detect putative, host-derived microorganisms that themselves have known associations with human health and diet. We also detect multiple enteric pathogens (e.g., Norovirus) and characterize viral diversity across sites. Moreover, we observed an enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in hospital wastewater; antibiotic-specific ARGs cor- related to total prescriptions of those same antibiotics (e.g Ampicillin, Genta- micin). Overall, this effort lays the groundwork for systematic characterization of wastewater that can potentially influence public health decision-making.\n\n\nCheck for updates\n\n\nWastewater is a wellspring for geospatially delineated, epidemiologically relevant public health data. One sample contains a cross-sectional\ncollection of human pathogens, commensals, animal/plant detritus,\nbiomolecules, and environmental features (e.g., pollutants) deriving\nfrom a specific locale. Depending on the sampling location, it represents small populations, like the residents of one building or entire\n\n\ncities. As a result, wastewater is a potential source for continuous,\nprecise monitoring of public health and potential pathogens for\ncommunities. Applications of wastewater-based epidemiological surveillance include tracking community drug abuse, pollutants, and\npathogen load[\u2013].\n\n\nA full list of affiliations appears at the end of the paper. [e-mail: btt4001@med.cornell.edu; hmsolo@miami.edu; chm2042@med.cornell.edu](mailto:btt4001@med.cornell.edu)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic galvanized efforts to develop low-cost\n\ntools for pathogen surveillance. Targeted sequencing of SARS-CoV-2\nwastewater gained popularity for its advantages over clinical or individual testing-based approaches. Wastewater surveillance can (1)\npredict outbreaks before cases spike, (2) eliminate individual patient\nlevel data, reducing privacy concerns, (3) capture undersampled\npopulations that may not be regularly tested, (4) be more costeffective than doing repeated individual tests, and (5) reduce the\nreliance on self-reported data, which has proven a challenge in estimating both global SARS-CoV-2 burden and individual vaccination\nstatus. Numerous prior studies have explored the use of targeted RNA\nsequencing in tracking pathogens, most notably SARS-CoV-2. These\nhave been executed in numerous areas around the globe, including the\nUS, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong, India, and Africa[\u2013].\n\nHowever, the utility of wastewater surveillance extends beyond\n\nmonitoring single pathogens. Many past wastewater studies tracked\nenvironmental pollutants, like heavy metals and fertilizer runoff ., or\nsewage in canals. Recent efforts have used a combination of targeted\n(e.g. Polymerase-Chain-Reaction(PCR)-based) and untargeted (e.g.\nshotgun) amplification approaches to characterize multiple pathogen\nabundances simultaneously, including clinically relevant enteric\nviruses. These have revealed uncharacterized microbial life in wastewater, some of which have the potential to be biomarkers for aspects\nof human and societal health, ranging from nutrition (derived from\nmetabolomics and 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing) to cardiovascular\ndisease and cancer[,]. More specifically, prior efforts have proved\nsuccessful at the detection of and culturing of bacterial pathogens and\nantimicrobial organisms in wastewater[\u2013].\n\nTo leverage these advances and explore the potential of micro\nbiome sequencing in monitoring public health, we collected and\namplicon-sequenced 966 (weekly, on average) samples from 34 sites in\nMiami-Dade County between 2020 and 2022 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary\nData 1). We performed targeted qPCR and targeted sequencing to\nestimate total SARS-CoV-2 and variant proportions. On an additional\nset of samples, (N = 1272), we completed bulk RNA sequencing to\nascertain the broader microbial community. We sampled five diverse\nlocation types: primary/secondary schools (median population size of\n1003 individuals across nine distinct sites), the University of Miami\nCampus wastewater basin (median population size of 1088 individuals\nacross six distinct sites), dormitories (median population size of 370\nindividuals across 16 distinct sites), hospitals (median population size\nof 340 individuals across five distinct sites), and a regional wastewater\ntreatment plant (representing a population of over 800,000). We\ndeveloped standardized collection and analysis workflows to holistically evaluate the microbial content of wastewater and generate\npublic-health-relevant guidance (Fig. 1a)[,][\u2013].\n\nBioinformatically, the analysis process involved quality control\n\n(i.e., filtering targeted sequencing data for samples with >75% SARSCoV-2 genome coverage at >10\u00d7) as well as, in the case of bulk data,\nprocessing with multiple algorithmic workflows (i.e., kmer-based\ntaxonomic classification, alignment-based taxonomy, de novo\n\nassembly-based approaches) and databases to yield multiple taxonomic and functional calls for each sample. The end result is a report\nintegrating multiple views into the composition of each wastewater\nsample during various waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Results\n#### Geospatially resolved wastewater vs. clinical SARS-CoV-2 variant tracking\nWe used targeted sequencing to generate high-resolution maps of\nSARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) levels across time based on\ncoverage in wastewater sequencing data (Supplementary Data 1). Our\nsequencing and analytic workflow was executed in part to reproduce\nother substantial efforts[,][,] to monitor SARS-CoV-2 VoC levels in\nwastewater while also adding the dimension of geospatial and\n\n\npopulation size variation in sampling locations. These past efforts have\nshown that wastewater VoC abundance correlates with population\nVoC abundance in clinical samples and can predict outbreaks[,]. We\nhypothesized that different sites provided distinct levels of lead time,\nfor example, in identifying outbreaks before clinical testing. In total,\nwe observed across all wastewater samples the rise and fall of the VoCs\nthat dominated the pandemic up to the Omicron BA5 strain. Wastewater VoC abundance was positively correlated with VOCs (Patient vs.\nWastewater: rho = 0.53, p < 0.001, Student vs. Wastewater: rho = 0.61,\np < 0.001) in 5442 sequenced or otherwise characterized samples from\nUniversity of Miami (UM) students (N = 1503) and the UM UHealth\nhospital patients (N = 3939 patients) (Fig. 1b, c).\n\nThe initial observation of different VoCs in wastewater was coin\ncident with their initial identification in these other samples, especially\ndata later in the pandemic as dominant variants became more defined.\nWe additionally observed that the monthly proportion of VoCs in\nwastewater varied over time (Fig. 1b, c), especially compared to the\nproportion of VoCs detected in the clinical and student settings\n(Fig. 1b); in other words, wastewater VoCs appeared to track the\nmonthly waves the pandemic more effectively that individual testing.\nVariant detection in wastewater preceded either (or both) student/\npatient detection for 5/8 VoCs identified in 2021 and 2022 (Supplementary Data 1). On average, VoCs in wastewater were identified within\n1.8 days of their identification in either student or patient samples.\nNotably, the delta variant was detected eight days in wastewater prior\nto its detection in student samples.\n\nNot only did the wastewater data provide an antecedent view of\n\ncirculating strains in patients, the data also gave a more complete\npicture of all variants circulating in Miami-Dade County than either the\nstudent or patient data alone, especially since these approaches relied\non random sampling-based with single individuals being tested\n(Fig. 1c). For example, the Mu variant was identified in the wastewater\nand patient data (at high coverage for the clade-specific variants), but\nnot in the student data, further indicating the propensity for individual\ntesting to overlook potential circulating VoCs.\n\nIn addition, the continual sampling of different wastewater sites\n\nenabled us to observe spatial variation in variant detection within the\ndifferent sites we collected wastewater (Fig. 1d). For example, the Eta\nvariant was present in March/April 2021 in the UM Campus Basin,\nwhereas Lambda was more detectable in wastewater treatment plants\nand UM dormitory sites. Mu was observed in hospital wastewater but\nin no other wastewater collection site. In this sense, geospatially\nresolved, continual targeted monitoring provided transmission\n\ninformation for alternative variants from potentially survey-undersampled, non-hospital-associated communities for alternative variant\ntransmission.\n\nAs expected, wastewater-based VoC surveillance enabled tracking\n\nof the mutational-level transitions between dominant strains across\ntime (Fig. 2). We were able to observe transitions in both unique and\nrecurrent mutations between VoCs. This high-resolution phylogenetic\ntracking enabled monitoring of the rise and fall of competing variants\nacross space. We attained clear tracking of the variant mutational\nlandscape despite using only weekly sampling.\n\n#### Wastewater contains human gut microbial taxa that have reported associations with nutrition and host health\nWhile the ability of targeted sequencing to track specific, lowabundance pathogen load in wastewater has been demonstrated, the\npotential utility of bulk RNA sequencing for monitoring public health\nhas been explored in only a few instances, predominantly for estimating virome composition. We hypothesized, however, that the\nbacterial gene expression of wastewater could provide signals correlated to either environmental health (e.g., correlation to contaminant\nabundance) and/or bioindicators for human community health.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\n\n-----\n\nmicrobial signals \u2013 both pathogenic and commensal \u2013 in different sites\nthat were derived clearly from taxa known to be associated with variation in human nutrition or gut health.\n\nWe collected 1272 bulk RNA sequencing samples. After read\n\nquality control, these data comprised 14.7 billionread pairs at a median\nper sample sequencing depth of 11,802,903 reads. This included control samples, which we used to bioinformatically filter potential processing and sequencing contaminants (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). We\nreport the taxa removed by this contaminant filtering process in\nSupplementary Data 2. We compared multiple taxonomic annotation\napproaches and found complementary results in the profiles they\nproduced (Supplementary Fig. 1). We recorded metadata on all samples and assemblies, and computed mapping summary statistics\n(Supplementary Data 3). With Kraken2, only a small percentage\n(median = 3.71%; first percentile = 1.80%, 99th percentile = 16.25%) of\nour reads went unclassified at the Domain level. While concordant in\nterms of genera identified, however, the three taxonomic classifiers we\nimplemented identified different numbers of species, with Kraken2\ncapturing the most, followed by Xtree, followed by MetaPhlan4. While\nthis could derive from variation in database size and/or sensitivity, we\nhypothesize the substantially fewer taxa identified by MetaPhlAn4\ncould arise from its classification strategy stemming from marker\ngenes instead of whole-genome based kmer-matching; metatranscriptomics will only capture transcriptionally active portions of a\ngenome, and there is no reason why active genes would be those that\nare discriminating in MetaPhlan4\u2019s database. Alternatively, kmerbased, whole-genome approaches could provide inflated species\nestimates due to false positive alignments. Xtree had the most overlap\nwith both classifiers, in total, and as such, for the rest of this section, we\nreport in figures the Xtree classifications that were found additionally\nby at least one other taxonomic classifier, unless otherwise stated.\n\nWe first observed that, as to be expected, the bacterial content of\n\nwastewater comprised an amalgamation of both host-associated\nclades as well as microbes normally found in the natural environment (Fig. 3a). We detected many human gut commensal families (e.g.\nRuminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Akkermansiaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae) as well as oral microbiome commensals (e.g., Nanogingivalaceae, Fusobacteriaceae). Outside of host-associated organisms, many\ndifferent environmental families, including those previously reported\nin wastewater (e.g. Rhodocyclaceae, Nitrospiraceae) were also\n\npresent[,]. The average abundance of these physiologically diverse\n(i.e., spanning both anaerobes and aerobes) taxa varied as one would\nexpect; clades more abundant in the wastewater treatment plant were\npreviously found to also be prevalent in activated sludge, whereas\nthe human-associated organisms were more abundant in other sites.\nOverall, the amalgam of human and environmental microbes increased\nour confidence that it could potentially contain a broad spectrum of\nbiomarkers indicative of different public health-relevant indications.\n\nTo better understand the patterns of site-specific bacterial abun\ndance variation observed in Fig. 3a, we next interrogated the seasonal\nvariation in bacterial microbiome content as a function of sampling\nlocation and population size (Fig. 3b). Measuring within-site variation\n(i.e., beta diversity, the dissimilarity between any pair of samples from\na given site), we found that each sampled location had distinct temporal signatures. Specifically, there was an inverse relationship\nbetween population size and average within-site variation. Areas serving low populations \u2013 most notably, dormitories, demonstrated high\nvariation in wastewater bacterial content between any two samples;\nconversely, the wastewater treatment plant samples had low variation\nand served a massive population.\n\nWe next aimed to identify the source of this site-specific differ\nence in variation, hypothesizing that it likely arose from high variation\nin some of the site-specific families present in Fig. 3a. We computed\noverlap in identified bacterial species between each site as well as each\nspecies average abundance and prevalence within a given location\n\n\ntype (dormitories, the entire university campus, primary/secondary\nschools, wastewater treatment plants, hospital/medical campus\nbuildings) (Fig. 3c). A total of 182 species were present in at least one\nsample from each of these five location types. These comprised predominantly members of the wastewater-specific and/or environmental\nfamilies (Fig. 3a). It was clear, however, that the sample-to-sample\nvariation in dormitory microbiota, as observed in Fig. 3b, was driven by\na large number (N = 646) of unique species that were both (1) high\nabundance (Fig. 3c, middle) and (2) low (i.e., less than 10%) prevalence\n(Fig. 3c, top). The overlaps between other sites were as expected; for\nexample, the University of Miami locations all shared more taxa with\neach other than with the wastewater plant or the primary/secondary\nschools.\n\nTo compute the microbiome architecture of wastewater[,], we\n\ncompleted a Microbial Association Study (MAS) between species\nabundance and sampling sites, representative population size, and\nvarious environmental features, like salinity and pH (Supplementary\nFig. 2). We considered a significant association as having a\n\nBenjamini\u2013Yekutieli (BY) p-value below 0.05. Bacterial composition\nwas associated most strongly with location type and population size,\nas expected, and these results were reproduced across taxonomic\nclassifiers (Supplementary Data 4). We confirmed that the organisms\nassociated with dormitories and other sites with low populations\ntended to be known human gut commensals (Fig. 3d, Supplementary\nData 4) and potentially pathogenic microbes (e.g., Klebsiella\n\npneumoniae).\n\nOverall, in wastewater samples representing small populations\n\n(<1000 individuals) the bacterial content comprised numerous taxa\ntypically observed in the gut microbiome that are known to be associated with dietary intake For example, F. prausnitzii, R. hominis,\nAnaerostipes hadrus, Agathobaculum butyriciproducens, and B. animalis, all found in our wastewater data, have been associated with\nhealthy plant-based and animal-based food intake. Similarly, other\norganisms found (e.g., Clostridium leptum, Bifidobacterium bifidum,\nEggerthella lenta, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Clostridium\n\ninnocuum), have been reported as associated with poor diets. This\nindicates that geospatially variable wastewater may be useful for\ntracking population dietary choices in wastewater samples representing small (<1000 individuals, as in the dormitories in this study)\npopulations.\n\nMoreover, many of these small-population-associated species are\n\nalso potential gut-based indicators of human disease or health status.\nFor example, F. prausnitzii has been repeatedly and robustly reported\nas inversely correlated with multiple diseases, including Colorectal\nCancer, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and Atherosclerosis[,][\u2013]. Bilophila wadsworthia, also detected in our dataset, is known to be causative for gastrointestinal discomfort and inflammation. There were\nalso some bacterial associations with environmental variables. We\nobserved other statistically significant, environmental indicators of\nwastewater microbiome content (Supplementary Data 4), including\npH (25 positive associations, 17 negative), specific conductivity (15\npositive, 0 negative), and dissolved oxygen content (49 positive\nassociations, 11 negative).\n\nWe additionally performed a more targeted search for additional\n\npotential bacterial pathobionts of interest. We used the most sensitive\ntaxonomic classifier (Kraken2) for this, as it was most likely to pick up\nlow-abundance organisms; however, it is also prone to false positives,\nso any results would need to be validated with further effort.\nRegardless, this approach identified numerous potential pathogens\npotentially filtered out by Xtree\u2019s coverage thresholds or not identified\nby alignment to MetaPhlAn4\u2019s marker gene database (Supplementary\nFig. 3), including Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus faecium, Shigella\nsonnei, and Bordetella pertussis, all of which are pathogens of interest\nto global health organizations, in large part due to their growing\nresistance to antibiotics[\u2013].\n\n\n-----\n\n#### De novo assembly and short-read alignment provide discrete views of wastewater virome composition\nThe wastewater virome has been proposed as a potential source for\nmonitoring viral community pathogen load writ large. With this in\nmind, we next interrogated the degree to which the wastewater\nvirome in our dataset could be used for both public health surveillance as well as discovering novel viral genomes. Akin to the\nbacterial analysis, we implemented multiple methods for viral discovery, using both short-read, kmer-based classification as well as\nde novo assembly.\n\n\nOverall, the virome demonstrated even greater within-site diver\nsity than bacterial clades (Supplementary Fig. 4). Despite this, there\nwas a similar trend in relative viral diversity between sites; lowpopulation sites had higher numbers of unique viruses. Only 52 species\nwere detected in every type of sampled location. Viral content had\nmore associations with environmental variables than bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 4). Detected viruses from\nshort-read alignment derived from families that targeted a diverse\narray of eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts and spanned genome compositions (ssRNA+, dsRNA, ssRNA-RT, and dsDNA, Fig. 4a), with the\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 3 | Wastewater bacterial phylogenetics and diversity. a The average relative\nabundance (RA) of all bacterial families represented in the metatranscriptomic\ndata. Outer rings correspond to mean abundance within a family across the different location types extending from the WWTP wastewater treatment plant\n(outermost ring) to SCHOOL primary/secondary school, UC university campus,\nDORM dormitory, and HOSP hospital, (innermost ring). The color of the family\nname corresponds to its phylum. b The top panel is the beta diversity (Bray Curtis\ndistance) between all samples within a given site. Each point in this panel represents\na comparison between two different samples taken from the same location (e.g.,\ntwo random samples from a given hospital). The line underneath the top panel\ncorresponds to the average beta diversity at each associated site. The dots in the\nPopulation Size sub-panel correspond to the approximate population served by the\nsite from which samples are being compared between. The colored blocks on the\nbottom are vertically aligned with the population size points and the beta diversity\n\nmost prevalent families across sites being Virgaviridae, Mitoviridae,\nTombusviridae, Betaflexiviridae, and Picornaviridae.\n\nAfter filtering assembled viral contigs for quality and potential\n\nviral genes, we identified 913,596 putative genomes of varying quality\n(903,349 low quality, 5490 medium quality, 4749 high quality, eight\ncomplete, Fig. 4b). Median genome length was 350 nt, 3076 nt,\n3730 nt, and 5093 nt for low, medium, high, and complete quality\ngenomes, respectively. Clustering these contigs at 90% percent identity resulted in 214,383 non-redundant genomes.\n\nWe assigned taxonomy to these contigs and found that they\n\ncaptured a discrete view of the wastewater virome compared to shortread alignment (Fig. 4c); de novo assembly overall outperformed\nshort-read alignment. For example, it captured 46 families and 7 phyla\n(Cossaviricota, Duplornaviricota, Negarnaviricota, Nucleocytoviricota,\nPeploviricota, Preplasmiviricota, Saleviricota) not detected by alignment. Analogously, both approaches yielded different views of viral\ngenome composition and target host domains: assembly detected\nexpression of ssDNA viruses, alignment did not. Assembly also captured greater phage diversity and more dsDNA viruses, whereas\nalignment captured more putative eukaryotic-targeting viruses and\nRNA viruses.\n\n#### Wastewater reveals numerous pathogenic viruses and novel viral clades\nGiven the assembly\u2019s ability to provide a taxonomically high-resolution\nview of wastewater viral communities, we aimed to characterize the\nphylogeny of assembled RNA viruses (Fig. 4e) using alignments of\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences, focusing specifically on\nthe kingdom Orthornavirae. Of the 7058 contigs visualized in Fig. 4e\nwhere RdRp could be detected, 6558 (92.9%) belonged to Lenarviricota. This analysis highlighted the challenge of taxonomically annotated (via HMM conservation) genomes; only 165 Lenarviricota\ngenomes had family-level annotations and only 568 (8.0%) of all contigs in this phylogeny even order-level genomad taxonomies, most of\nthem in Picornavirales.\n\nTo gain a higher resolution of assembled contigs potentially\n\nrelevant to human health, we focused specifically on contigs annotated\nas Pisuviricota, a phylum containing numerous mammalian pathogens\n(Fig. 4f). To identify potential species-level annotation, we used BLAST\nto align assembled contigs against all complete genomes in NCBI\nRefSeq at the 90% identity level, a method utilized in related efforts.\nTo increase confidence in the results displayed, we filtered this tree for\ncontigs above 1000 base pairs. This analysis resulted in the identification of multiple humanpathogens, including Norovirus GII, Sapovirus\nMC10, Mamastrovirus 1 B1347, and a Human astrovirus. The abundance\nof these and/or viral strains was present in the short-read alignment\ndata as well. We note that their assembled contigs were annotated as\nlow-quality however their ability to be placed on a reasonable phylogeny, have high homology to reference genomes, and were detected\nvia multiple algorithmic approaches, which indicates that even poor\n\ndotplots, and colors correspond to the different sampling location types indicated\nin the legend. Boxplots represent the median (center line), the 25th (lower bound of\nthe box), and 75th (upper bound of the box) percentiles. The whiskers extend to the\nsmallest and largest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the\nlower and upper quartiles, respectively. c The intersections between different\nlocation types, with the bars indicating the intersection size and the black dots\nindicating the sites underneath being compared.

Bacteria occurring in at least three samples and with a BY-adjusted pvalue of less than 0.1 are plotted. Orange names indicate gut commensals. Source\ndata are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nquality assembled genomes can feasibly be used for pathogen\ndetection.\n\nWe additionally searched the viral assemblies, Kraken2 align\nments, and Xtree alignments for viral genomes not represented in\nFig. 4 that were of potential public health interest. For example,\nadditional human-relevant viruses (i.e., other Norovirus strains, an\n8280 base pair putative Aichivirus genome) were also annotated by\nalignment to BLAST but were too short or divergent to be included in\nthe phylogeny (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). Kraken2 was also identified, via\nshort-read alignment.\n\n#### Antimicrobial resistance genes in wastewater are associated with hospital antibiotic prescription levels\nHaving explored targeted RNA sequencing, bacterial metatranscriptomics, and viral metatranscriptomics, we next evaluated the\npublic health benefit of one final microbial data modality: Antimicrobial Resistance Gene (ARGs). Since ARGs are the functional unit\nof microbial resistance, these data could feasibly provide a highresolution view into the public health relevance of wastewater\nsequencing for ARG tracking.\n\nSpecifically, we queried the variation in both markers of patho\ngenicity as well as ARG presence in our dataset. We identified\n36,378,395 called Open-Reading Frames (ORFs) in the de novo\nassemblies. We identified putative ORFs annotated as human healthrelevant pathogen-associated proteins as those that varied significantly (adjusted p-value < 0.05) across location types as measured\nby ANOVA (Supplementary Fig. 6). These included various fimbrial\nproteins, virulence factors, and cell surface proteins involved in\ninfection. We additionally identified other genes associated with\nmicrobial-borne disease mechanisms, like CagA, which is the causative\ngene for Helicobacter pylori-caused gastric cancer. Wastewater is\nhypothesized to be a mode of transmission for H. pylori infection[,].\nWe provide, as a genomics resource to the community, our nonredundant protein catalogs clustered at 90% (7,708,163 clustered\nproteins), 70% (5,171,907 clustered proteins), 50% (3,691,505 clustered\nproteins), and 30% (3,243,790 clustered proteins) with full annotation\ndata (see \u201cData availability\u201d section).\n\nWe found numerous ARGs throughout our dataset and hypothe\nsized that low-population size sites with high-antibiotic exposure (e.g.,\nhospitals), would have more antimicrobial resistance writ large than,\nsay, wastewater treatment plants, where ARGs have been previously\nidentified by other methods predominantly outside of bulk RNA\nsequencing (e.g., long-read sequencing, culturing)[\u2013]. Identification in\nmetatranscriptomics could then identify the activity of these genes as\nopposed to solely their abundance. Accordingly, we identified an\nenrichment of these genes overall in hospital samples, compared to all\nother samples (Fig. 5a). Dormitories had the second-most ARGs,\nwhereas wastewater treatment plants had the fewest. ARGs were\nconsistently the highest in hospitals across all timepoints, and we did\nnot identify any clear seasonality in their monthly variation (Fig. 5b).\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 4 | Wastewater viral phylogenetics and diversity through assembly vs.\nshort-read alignment. a The relative abundance (RA) of top viral families.

Annotation bars on the left-hand side correspond to the International\nCommittee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) proposed genome composition, geNomad phylum, and ICTV host range for a given geNomad family-level annotation.\nAlignments were done to a database of 9 public databases comprising 6 million+\ndereplicated, taxonomically annotated, and quality-controlled viral genomes (see\n\u201cMethods\u201d section).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe next evaluated the specific antibiotics and drug classes (Sup\nplementary Fig. 6, Fig. 5c) to which identified ARGs ostensibly conferred resistance. Via t-tests, we identified an enrichment of resistance\n(adjusted p-value < 0.05) to specific types of commonly prescribed\nantibiotics in hospitals compared to other sites. Tobramycin, Dibekacin, Cefalotin, and Gentamicin resistance dominated in hospitals\n\n\n(Supplementary Fig. 7). By drug class, penam, cephalosporin, and\ncarbapenem resistance were enriched in hospital wastewater, consistent with the presence of the dominant ARGs. The most prevalent\nARGs in hospital wastewater encoded beta-lactamase resistance\n(Fig. 5d). These genes included GES, KPC, NPS, TEM, CTX-M, CARB,\nMIR, and FOX.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 5 | The antimicrobial resistance landscape of wastewater across time\nand space. a The total number of called Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs)\nacross different sample types per 10 thousand reads, with p-values deriving from ttests on log10 transformed ARG counts normalized by sequencing depth.

Asterisks correspond to if a given ARG was enriched (in terms of\nlog10 observations per 10k reads) in hospital wastewater when compared to all\nother sites according to the adjusted p-value on a t-test. P-values were adjusted by\nthe Benjamini\u2013Yekutieli procedure. For an asterisk to be present, an antibiotic class\n\nConversely, certain antibiotics and drug classes (e.g., Kasugamy\ncin, Telithromycin, Capreomycin, Tetracyclines, Glycopeptides) had\nsimilar resistance profiles between all wastewater sites. We hypothesize, therefore, that these signs of putative resistance may not derive\nfrom exposure to the same concentration of antibiotics as in hospitals,\nbut rather may be indicative of naturally occurring microbial\nmachinery that, while potentially conferring resistance in certain\ncontexts, in this case, are expressed to serve another purpose. Alternatively, specific resistance genes could be deriving from highly similar\nantibiotics, instead of those named in Supplementary Fig. 7.\n\nConsidering that perceived antibiotic resistance may not actually\n\nbe driven by antibiotic exposure in some cases, we aimed to validate\nour observation of enriched resistance profiles in hospital wastewater\nby integrating hospital antibiotic prescription data. We acquired\nmonth-by-month prescription data from the hospital sites we sampled\nin Miami and computed correlations between observed antimicrobial\nresistance (both overall and on a specific antibiotic basis). To generate\na null set of comparisons we computed correlations between prescription data and hospital ARG abundance as well as correlations\nbetween prescription data and ARG abundance in all other sites,\nhypothesizing that non-hospital sites would have limited to no correlation, overall, with prescriptions.\n\nWe found statistically significant (p < 0.05), moderate positive\n\ncorrelations (Pearson correlation between all antibiotics in hospitals\nand all ARGs = 0.25) between both (1) overall antibiotic prescriptions\nand amount of overall hospital wastewater ARGs across all other sites\n(Fig. 5e) and (2) Ampicillin and Gentamicin prescriptions and their\nassociated specific resistance genes in each specific location type\n(Fig. 5f). Correlations with Ciproflaxin and Oxacillin were also trending\nin significance (p < 0.1). In other words, the prescription of specific\nantibiotics correlates to the amount of genes for resistance to those\nantibiotics in wastewater. Notably, as one would expect, we did not\nobserve these correlations in other sites: this result was unique to\nhospitals. No correlation was identified between, say, dormitory or\nwastewater ARG load and hospital prescriptions. We claim this\nobservation strengthens the hypothesis that wastewater ARG levels\ncan predict the spread of antibiotic resistance in a given community\n[based on antibiotic use data (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396544/)\n[articles/PMC6396544/), potentially meaning wastewater could be](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396544/)\nused to directly advise physician prescriptions and guide antibiotic\nstewardship.\n\n## Discussion\nIn this longitudinal wastewater microbial census, we integrated targeted qPCR plus targeted and untargeted RNA sequencing to detail the\nbacterial, viral, and functional landscape of samples from multiple\nareas within Miami-Dade County across two years. By combining these\ndifferent approaches, we capture the breadth and depth of microbial\ndiversity: targeted sequencing, for example, can identify viruses\nbeyond the limit of detection of bulk sequencing (down to 100\ngenomic copies per liter)[,], which itself is superior at measuring\n\n\nmust have been enriched in all four comparisons (e.g., hospitals vs dormitories,\nhospitals vs the university campus, hospitals vs primary schools, and hospitals vs\nthe wastewater treatment plant). e The Pearson correlation between the sum total\nof all sampled hospital antibiotic prescriptions and the total ARG counts per 10k for\nhospitals (black) and (all other sites). This color scheme only applies to this panel.\nData are presented as a linear regression line (mean values) surrounded by 95%\nconfidence intervals (area shaded in gray). f The same as (e), except the only genes\nconsidered in the correlation are those annotated as conferring resistance for the\ntwo antibiotics listed. The antibiotic data, similarly, is only for prescriptions of\nthose two antibiotics. Data are presented as a linear regression line (mean values)\nsurrounded by 95% confidence intervals (area shaded in gray). Source data are\nprovided as a Source Data file, and all p-values reported stem from two-sided tests.\n\noverall community composition. Further, we leverage and compare\nmultiple, redundant bioinformatic approaches, demonstrating how\ndifferent algorithms (assembly vs. short-read alignment, for example),\nhighlight distinct site-specific and shared microbial features. With the\nincreased integration of wastewater sequencing and geospatial epidemiologic data, we can identify increasingly precise signatures for\nthese and other features, potentially replacing onerous and costly\npublic health surveillance methods in the long run.\n\nOverall, we showed that wastewater can be potentially used for (1)\n\nviral pathogen detection, (2) observing gut-associated microorganisms positively and negatively associated with human health, and (3)\ntracking geospatially varying and prescription-correlated, drug classspecific, community antimicrobial resistance. In addition to various\npathogens of interest, we detected microbes known to be found in the\nhuman gut that have reported associations with human health and\nhuman habits, including F. prausnitzii, R. hominis, and B. wadsworthia.\nFinally, resistance genes for fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins,\n\npenams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and glycylcyclines antibiotics\nwere detected at high concentrations in hospital wastewater samples.\nMany of the specific genes we identified are plasmid-encoded enzymes\nand are responsible for the rise of resistant infections worldwide.\n\nAs a result, based on the current needs within public health sur\nveillance and the results of this (and other) studies, we propose two\nimmediate courses of action for extending these efforts and building\ntools that leverage wastewater microbiome ecology to track public\nhealth: (1) using wastewater to mitigate community antibiotic resistance spread by, for example, advising physician prescriptions based\nARG wastewater abundance (comparing ARGs detected in wastewater\nsequencing to existing approaches, like hospital-specific anti\nbiograms) and (2) monitoring pathogens and determining the feasibility of constructing gut health indicators of community diet and\noverall disease prevalence. This could include, for example, exploring\nthe potential to discover biomarkers of cancer. Regarding the former,\nnew antimicrobial resistance markers could feasibly be discovered by\ncorrelation prescription levels with de novo assembled gene abundance in wastewater. Regarding the latter: for validation and biomarker development, existing, zip code-stratified public health\nsurveillance datasets, like the National Health Administration Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), should be integrated with ongoing\nwastewater sequencing in the same zip codes to identify wastewaterbased correlates of the variables (e.g., lab tests, dietary survey data,\ndisease burden) recorded in NHANES. Together, these two initiatives\ncould provide a tool to mitigate antibiotic resistance in real-time while\nalso tracking public health and nutrition at high resolution (e.g.,\nmonitoring the spread of food deserts).\n\nTo take advantage of wastewater\u2019s potential as a single point\n\nsource for monitoring multiple population-level characteristics,\nuniting both targeted (e.g., specific pathogens or resistance markers)\nand untargeted analyses (metagenomics or metatranscriptomics)\n[will be critical (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721042509)\n[S0048969721042509). Targeted ARTIC sequencing, for example,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721042509)\n\n\n-----\n\ncan identify extremely low-abundance (parts per billion) viruses that\nrequire many rounds of amplification via PCR to be able to sequence.\nIt could feasibly also be used to target specific disease-causing\nmicrobial genes, like CagA (in the case of gastrointestinal cancer).\nHowever, it is limited in its ability to only capture a single organism\nper set of primers. Bulk sequencing, on the other hand, can theoretically capture information from all domains of life living in wastewater. Given that wastewater is an aggregate of environmental and\nhuman biology from a single geography, it stands to reason that\nmicrobial signals in wastewater could be used as a one-stop-shop for\npublic health surveillance. From heavy metal levels (e.g., lead, copper, fertilizer runoff) to gut health to cancer clusters, theoretically,\nintegrated microbial surveillance could capture all modalities in one\nsample type for low cost, with limited privacy concerns.\n\nAn added benefit of the wastewater surveillance documented\n\nhere, specifically, is the continuous monitoring of geographically distinct sites serving different community sizes. We observed variation in\nmicrobial composition and consistency across represented population\nsize, for example, observing low variability in wastewater treatment\nplant microbiomes compared to dormitories. It stands to reason that\ntemporal variation in major environmental pollutants might be best\nmonitored at treatment plants, whereas isolated outbreaks (e.g., gastroenteritis) might be better tracked at locations housing smaller\npopulations.\n\nOf course, our approach is not without drawbacks. Some SARS\nCoV-2 genomes were likely filtered out due to our coverage threshold,\nsome wastewater samples had low depth of sequencing, and a certain\namount of data could be lost prior to collection or during processing;\nthis can dramatically confound associations. Similarly, our processing\nmethods (electronegative filtration, etc), could skew microbial community composition. Further, microbes from other hosts (e.g., farm\nanimals) that appear human-associated could add noise to public\nhealth signals, so monitoring and controlling sampling locations\ncarefully will be critical. Analogously, some genes \u2013 like ARGs \u2013 that\nappear human health-relevant may in fact just be naturally occurring\nand not utile biomarkers. Additionally, bioinformatic annotation of\nviruses is extremely challenging; as we observed, species-level resolution is difficult to attain and can yield false positives. Even BLASTing\nat a high percent identity (>90% in our case) could yield misclassifications at the species level. Finally, we focus here on viruses and\nbacteria; fungi are also important for human health and detectable in\nwastewater[,]. Feasibly, this dataset we generated could be used, in\nfuture work, to measure fungal pathogen abundance as well.\n\nIn total, by uniting targeted pathogen tracking with broad\n\nmonitoring of epidemiologically relevant microbial and environmental signals, there is a potential to use wastewater as a primary\nsource for monitoring multiple dimensions of public health. The\ndevelopment of consistent protocols for sampling, sequencing, and\nanalyzing wastewater data is critical for it to achieve clinical impact\n[(https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00045).](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00045) Fur\nther, once these protocols are established, robust biomarkers for\nhuman population health must be discovered via large-scale association studies, leveraging those that have been successful in other\ndisciplines[,][\u2013]. This study represents an additional step in this\ndirection. Overall, by characterizing the ecology and its variation\nacross time and space, we aimed to lay the groundwork for building a\ndataset of taxa of interest to be monitored with bulk RNA sequencing\nalongside targeted approaches for pathogens of import. While\nshotgun metagenomics and metranscriptomics methods hold rich\ninformation about a wide range of pathogens, they can also be used\n[to monitor host dynamics, drug interactions, (https://pubmed.ncbi.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712587/)\n[nlm.nih.gov/33712587/), and eukaryotic species as well (https://](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712587/)\n[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26836631/). Future studies can link to](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26836631/)\nchanges in other organisms\u2019 movements and genotypes (e.g. zoonotic reservoirs), and also link to national-level wastewater profiling,\n\n\nsuch as the CDC\u2019s National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS).\nEventually, linking regional, national, and international datasets\nwould empower a global, semi-automated surveillance system, which\ncould serve as a first line of defense against future pandemics, contaminant buildup, ARG tracking, and establish essential tools to\nmitigate future public health crises.\n\n## Methods\n#### Study design and IRB approval\nThe goalof the study wasto evaluate associations between clinical data\nand wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in matched populations as well\nas describe the microbial composition of wastewater via bulk RNA\nsequencing. This project was approved by the University of Miami IRB\n(#20210164). Starting the Fall 2020 semester, to optimize on-campus\nsafety against the spread of COVID-19, the University of Miami\nembarked on a clinical tracking program based on testing, tracking,\nand tracing (3-T). For students who lived or commuted to campus, the\nUniversity required weekly or bi-weekly testing. Employees were tested on a random basis.\n\nAll patient data used in this study was published in a separate\n\nmanuscript, Carattini et al. . Documented clinical data were available\non a building basis at the University of Miami dormitories, for the\nUniversity campus for both student and employee populations who\nresided or commuted to campus, and at the University of Miami hospital. In addition, a subset of positive clinical samples (both students\nand employees) were amplified for SARS-CoV-2 variants and\n\nsequenced at a University of Miami laboratory (Oncogenomics Shared\nResource, OGSR). The OGSR ran both the clinical and wastewater\nsamples reported in this study providing for consistency in the\ndetection between both datasets. The sharing of clinical data for\ninternal research purposes was approved by the University of Miami\nIRB (IRB ID: 20210164, MOD00047150). In addition, at the county level,\nthe Florida Department of Health documented positive COVID-19\ndetections by zip code and this data was provided to the research team\nthrough delegation of the above IRB. Given the availability of clinicallybased data, the wastewater sample collection program was designed\nto provide a population match between clinical data and populations\ncontributing wastewater to a specific wastewater sampling location. A\nwaiver of consent was obtained for the retrospective review of charts\nand test results, and for the review of aggregated and deidentified data\ninclusive of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing results from environmental and\nclinical samples.\n\n#### Sample collection\nSamples were collected weekly from September 30, 2020, through\nSeptember 21, 2022. Sampling sites included sewer holes from residential dormitories (14 sites), sites representing major portions of\ncampus (4 sites, 3 corresponding to the main residential campus and 1\ncorresponding to the university marine campus with no residences),\nfrom laboratory/administrative buildings at the medical campus\n(2 sites), from the University Hospital (2 sites), grade school sites (8\nlocations representing 9 grade schools, 3 high schools, 2 middle\nschools, and 4 elementary schools with one elementary school and one\nmiddle school discharging to the same sewer hole), and from a\nregional wastewater treatment plant (Central District) serving a\npopulation of 830,000 from Miami-Dade County. In addition, at three\nsites both grab and composite samples were collected accounting for\nthe balance of the 34 sampling sites. Between September 2021 and\nJanuary 2022, samples were collected two times per week at the dormitory sites to provide additional data for on-campus mitigation\nmeasures.\n\nComposite samples were collected at the building and cluster\n\nscale using either an ISCO 6712 autosampler (time-paced) or at the\ncommunity-scale wastewater treatment plant using a HACH autosampler (flow-paced). All other samples were collected using a grab\n\n\n-----\n\nsampling technique, due to the limited availability of multiple autosamplers. Sample collection volumes were 2 liters with the first liter\nbeing used for water quality analyses in the field (pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, and turbidity). Additional details about sample collection and basic water quality data have\nbeen published earlier[,][,][,].\n\nPrimary concentration and downstream processing of wastewater.\nUpon collection, wastewater was transported to the Biospecimen\nShared Resource Laboratory at the University of Miami on ice and\nimmediately succumbed to pretreatment for a primary concentration\nof suspended solids. Wastewater samples had [10 genomic copies\n(gc)/L] human coronavirus-OC43 added as a recovery tool for quantitative PCR assessment, occurring prior to targeted sequencing. Additionally, 51% w/v magnesium chloride was added as well as drops of\n10% Hydrochloric Acid (pH reduction down to 3.5\u20134.5) to assist with\naltering the chemical charge of ambient viral particles found in wastewater to positive. The primary concentration method employed was\nElectronegative Filtration (ENF) using HAWP mixed cellulose ester\nmembranes (Millipore Sigma #HAWP04700, 47 mm diameter, 0.45 \u00b5m\npore size) which were negatively charged, thus requiring the necessity\nfor the pretreatment to aid in binding affinity between the viral particles and membranes. Via the use of vacuum filtration, electronegative\nHAWP membranes captured wastewater-suspended solids, and variable sample volumes (20\u2013150 mL, depending upon turbidity and water\nquality parameters) were filtered until clogging/filter saturation to\ncreate concentrates. HAWP filter membranes containing a saturated\nlayer of suspended wastewater solids were folded in on themselves\nfour times, and placed immediately within 1.5 mL 1\u00d7 DNA/RNA shield\nwithin 5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Three filter concentrate replicates\nwere generated per wastewater sample collected over the course of\nthe study period; each replicate was sent to a separate laboratory, the\nCenter for AIDS Research (CFAR) Laboratory (on ice), the OGSR\nLaboratory (on ice) both at the University of Miami and at Weill Cornell\nMedicine (WCM) (on dry ice).\n\nThree workflows were implemented to extract SARS-CoV-2 from\n\nwastewater which occurred in separate laboratories to standardize and\nachieve overlapping analyses following extraction. These processes\nincluded quantitative PCR (at CFAR), ARTIC analysis (at the OGSR), and\nbulk RNA sequencing (at WCM). At the CFAR laboratory the Zymo\nResearch QuickRNA-Viral Kit, with a modified protocol using 250 \u00b5L\nwastewater concentrate - discussed in detail within Babler et al. to\nreduce inhibition - was utilized as input for Volcano 2nd GenerationqPCR (V2G-qPCR). This in-house created assay is equivalent to that of\nRT-qPCR but bypasses the need for the initial reverse transcription\nstep as the DNA polymerase utilized within the reaction can read both\nRNA and DNA templates, thus reducing the total reaction time and\nallowing for additional analyses of other targets within the same\ntimeframe (i.e., normalization parameters, control parameters). To\nassess for inhibition within RNA samples, 30 \u00b5L of HIV RNA was added\nto each 10 \u00b5L eluate of wastewater RNA, and assessed alongside a\nweekly generated water control (10 \u00b5L Nuclease-Free water + 30 \u00b5L HIV\nRNA) by V2G-qPCR; following amplification, the Cq values were compared and if the wastewater sample Cq values measured within \u00b12\ncycles of the water control, samples were considered uninhibited.\n\nThe choice for determining which samples were ultimately\n\nbrought through ARTIC analyses, via collaborative communication\nbetween CFAR and OGSR, was based on the gc/L measurements\ndetermined by V2G-qPCR taking into consideration the overall recovery and inhibition as determined by the controls. This was because\nroutine extraction and multiple V2G-qPCR assessments occurred\nwithin the CFAR laboratory weekly, wherein the filter replicate sent to\nthe OGSR following concentration was kept at \u221280 \u00b0C until extracted in\nbatches for specific analyses.\n\n\n#### Targeted sequencing of SARS-CoV-2\nLibraries were synthesized using the NEBNext\u00ae ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 FS\nLibrary Prep Kit (E7658L) following the Express Protocol and\nemploying the V3 primer set throughout. Eight microliters of total\nnucleic acid (TNA) extracted with Nanotrap Microbiome Particles\n(Ceres Nanoscience, 44202) enrichment and MagMAX\u2122 Viral/Pathogen Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher ScientificSciencific,\nA42356) were used as input without quantification nor assessment of\nRNA integrity. Finished libraries were pooled volumetrically with final\npools of 96 libraries cleaned using 0.9\u00d7 AMPure bead cleanup (Beckman A63882). Pools were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using\nMid-Output 150 cycle flowcells (130 M clusters, 20024904) run as 76|8|\n8|76 chemistry or NovaSeq 6000 using various flow (SP S1, S2 or S4;\n20028400, 20028319, 20028317 20028314, or 20028312, respectively)\nas 151|8|8|151 chemistry, with up to 3% PhIX (FC-110-3001).\n\n#### Detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in ARTIC data\nBroadly speaking, the pipeline for variant detection involved (1) identification of reads aligning to the SARS-CoV-2 genome with Kraken2,\n(2) aligning to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference and filtering samples based\non breadth and depth of alignment coverage, (3) trimming primers, (4)\ncalling variants using an ensemble approach, (5) annotating mutations,\nand (8) estimating VOC lineage abundances. All software was run with\nthe default settings unless otherwise specified.\n\nWe used Kraken2 (V2.1.2) running the default settings to tax\nonomically classify short-read sequencing data for the ARTIC samples.\nWe used a custom Kraken2 database that included the SARS-CoV-2\nWuhan-Hu-1 reference (GCF_009858895) as well as an assortment of\nviral, archaeal, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, and mammalian genomes\n(available upon request). The reads assigned exclusively as SARS-CoV2 were then filtered into individual files using seqtk (V1.3-r106).\nAlignment to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference was done with bwa (V0.7.17r1188), and the alignment was then sorted and indexed with sambamba. We then trimmed primers with ivar (V1.13) and generated\ncoverage statistics afterward with the bedtools genomecov (V2.30.0)\ncommand and mosdepth (V0.3.3). We filtered out samples that did not\nhave at minimum 10\u00d7 mean coverage per amplicon across at least 73 of\nthe 98 amplicons (roughly 75%) that were targeted by the ARTIC\nprotocol.\n\nFor variant calling, we used an ensemble approach, combining the\n\noutput of lofreq (V2.1.5), and iVar, only the union of calls found in both\napproaches, and computing the mean variant allele frequency\nbetween the two. We used VEP (V104.3) to annotate mutations and\nestimate VOC lineage abundance with Freyja (V1.4.2), using the latest\navailable VOC database (as of April 2023), provided by the software.\n\n#### Bulk RNA sequencing\nAfter concentration via ENF, the filter concentrates were preserved in\n1.5 mL of 1\u00d7 DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, R1100), transported on\ndry ice, and remained stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing at Weill\nCornell Medical College. Nucleic acid extraction took place using the\nDreamPrep NAP workstation (TECAN, NAP-DREAMPREP), a liquidhandling automation device, and the Quick-DNA/RNA Viral Magbead\nKit (Zymo Research, R2140) using 400 \u00b5L of wastewater concentrate,\nfollowing manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nSamples were sequenced in two batches by two separate provi\nders. HudsonAlpha Discovery (Huntsville, AL) performed the first\nsequencing library preparation on the generated nucleic acids. The\nnucleic acid samples underwent purification using the RNA Clean and\nConcentrator Magbead Kit with DNase digestion (Zymo Research,\nR1082), following the manufacturer\u2019s recommended protocol on the\nBiomek i5 automated workstation (Beckman Coulter, 52018). This\nprocess resulted in an 18 \u00b5L elution of RNA in nuclease-free water. The\nLabTouch GX Touch (Perkin Elmer, CLS137031/C) nucleic acid analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem quantified the RNA, with samples prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions.\n\nAfter normalizing RNA concentrations, sequencing libraries were\n\ngenerated using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat)\nand NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs,\nE6310X, E7645L) for Illumina. The KAPA Library Quantification Kit\n(Roche, 07960140001) was employed to quantify the resulting\nlibraries, all samples were brought to 20 cycles of PCR at the final step.\nAll libraries were next evaluated and pooled at equimolar concentrations. Sequencing was carried out on the NovaSeq 6000 platform\n(Illumina, 20012850) with an S4 flow cell, using a read length of\n2 \u00d7 151 bp in paired-end configuration.\n\nThe second batch of samples were sequenced by Element Bios\nciences. The nucleic acid samples underwent purification identical to\nthat of HudsonAlpha Discovery, using the RNA Clean and Concentrator Magbead Kit with DNase digestion (Zymo Research, R1082),\nwhich cuts both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. The\nresulting elution of RNA was quantified using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer\n(ThermoFisher, Q33238), using 10 ng of total input for the library\npreparation. The sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) and NEBNext Ultra II\nDNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, E6310X, E7645L) for Illumina, following the vendor protocol with two modifications. First,\nElement Biosciences adapters and unique dual indexes (Element\nBiosciences, 830-00005) were used instead of NEB-recommended\nIllumina adapters and indexes. Second, because of this change, the\nUSER treatment step was omitted. Completed libraries were quantified\nby Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size\ndetermination. Libraries were pooled and then circularized and\nquantified using the Element Elevate Library Circularization Kit (Element Biosciences, 830-00001). Sequencing was performed using the\nElement AVITI sequencing instrument (Element Biosciences, AVITI),\nusing 2 \u00d7 75 bp high output kits (Element Biosciences, 860-00004) run\nin HD Expert Mode.\n\n#### Metatranscriptomic quality control and short-read taxonomic profiling\nWe submitted all short-read metatranscriptomic sequencing data first\nto a quality control pipeline, predominantly using the bbtools suite\n(V38.92). Clumpify (parameters: optical=f, dupesubs=2,dedupe=t)\nwas used to group overlapping reads, and bbduk (parameters: qout=33\ntrd=t hdist=1 k=27 ktrim=\u201cr\u201d mink=8 overwrite=true trimq=10\n\nqtrim=\u2018rl\u2019 threads=10 minlength=51 maxns=\u22121 minbase\nfrequency=0.05 ecco=f) was used to deduplicate reads and remove\nadapters, accounting for duplicates generated by the PCR-amplication\nprocess. Potential human contaminating reads were removed by\nbowtie2 (V2.4.4, parameters: --very-sensitive-local) alignment to the\nHG38 human genome assembly. Any samples remaining with uneven\nnumbers of reads were repaired with bbtools\u2019 repair function. Finally,\ntadpole (parameters: mode=correct, ecc=t, ecco=t) was used to correct sequencing errors.\n\nQuality-controlled reads were run through different taxonomic\n\nclassification approaches: (1) Kraken2 (V2.1.2) against all of the complete genomes for microorganisms on RefSeq (2) and MetaPhlan4\n(V4.0.4) against its default database, (3) Xtree (V0.92i) against the\nGenome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) r207, and (4) Xtree against the\ndataset of complete a 6 million dereplicated, high-quality viral genomes (the Pan Viral Compendium) from nine public databases, the\n[metadata of which is available at Figshare (https://figshare.com/](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PVC_Release_V0_1/24566995/1)\n[articles/dataset/PVC_Release_V0_1/24566995/1). All of the genomes in](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PVC_Release_V0_1/24566995/1)\nthese listed databases were dereplicated at the 90% identity level and\nquality checked and annotated with CheckV and geNomad (identically\nas described below in the de novo assembly section). Alignments were\ndone to the database of dereplicated complete, high, and mediumquality genomes.\n\n\nWe ran Kraken2 with both \u2013confidence 0.2 and \u2013confidence 0.0\n\nflags; the latter parameter was only used for estimating total, domainlevel read alignment. The former was used for species-level annotations (e.g., as presented in Supplementary Fig. 3). Abundance matrices\nfor both confidence flags are available online (see \u201cData availability\u201d\nsection).\n\nXtree is a kmer-based aligner that generates coverage statistics\n\n(global, which corresponds to total genome coverage, and unique,\nwhich corresponds to reads mapping to a specific genome in the\ndatabase). We filtered for bacterial genomes with 1% global and 0.5%\nunique coverage. We filtered for viral genomes with 20% global and\n10% unique coverage. Relative abundances for Xtree were computed\nby dividing the total aligned reads to a given genome over the total\nnumber of reads aligning to all genomes. MetaPhlAn4 computed\nrelative abundance automatically. We used Bracken to compute relative abundances for the kraken2 output. All the figures in the text were\ngenerated with the Xtree relative abundances unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\nThe bacterial phylogeny generated in Fig. 2a was generated by\n\n[subsetting the GTDB taxonomic tree (provided at https://data.gtdb.](https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release214/214.1/)\n[ecogenomic.org/releases/release214/214.1/) to the species identified in](https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release214/214.1/)\nthe metatranscriptomic data. Family-level representatives were selected at random. Their abundance, reported in the circular heatmap, was\ncomputed by averaging the relative abundance of all species in that\ngiven family.\n\n#### Removal of potential kitome or sequencing contaminants\nTo account for potential contaminants from sample processing, we\nadditionally sequenced and bioinformatically leveraged 15 negative\ncontrols. These were uninoculated DNA preservative buffered (DNA/\nRNA Shield) taken during extraction that was sequenced alongside the\nother samples. We used the decontam R package (isContaminant\nfunction, parameters: method=\u201cprevalence\u201d, threshold=0.5) on all\nrelative abundance matrices generated by the above alignment\nstrategies. We used the parameters and approach derived from the\nfollowing example: [https://benjjneb.github.io/decontam/vignettes/](https://benjjneb.github.io/decontam/vignettes/decontam_intro.html)\n\n[decontam_intro.html. Taxa removed during decontamination from](https://benjjneb.github.io/decontam/vignettes/decontam_intro.html)\neach matrix are reported in Supplementary Data 2. Both decontaminated and raw abundance matrices are available (see \u201cData availability\u201d\nsection).\n\n#### Microbial Association Study\nThe Microbial Association Study (MAS) reported in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4 was executed via a linear mixed modeling\napproach. Relative abundances were log-transformed with the smallest non-zero abundance value being added to the entire matrix\nbeforehand. The following mixed effects model was fit for each bacterial/viral species that was found in over 10 samples:\n\nlog 10\u00f0microbial f eature\u00de \u223c f eature + \u00f01jlocationID\u00de\n\nThe independent variable is the log10 transformed abundance of\n\nany given bacteria and the dependent \u201cfeature\u201d variables are the features described in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4 and Supplementary\nData 4. Note that log10 transformation worked slightly differently for\neach aligner based on the raw data they output. MetaPhlan4 and\nBracken give relative abundances (ranging from 0 to 100 for the former, and from 0 to 1 for the latter); for both, we added a pseudocount\nof 0.000001 to all zeros. Xtree gives raw counts. For it, we replaced all\nzero values prior to computing relative abundance with 0.5 and then\nlog10 transformed. P-values were adjusted via the Benjamini\u2013Yekutieli\nprocedure, and an adjusted cutoff of 0.05 was used to gauge\nsignificance.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### De novo assembly, viral contig identification and annotation, gene catalog construction, and Resistance Gene/Open-Reading- Frame identification\nQuality-controlled reads were de novo assembled using\n\nMetaViralSPAdes V3.15.5. The soft filtered transcripts output by\nMetaViralSPAdes were fed into CheckV V0.7.0 to predict putative viral\ncontigs. For all high, complete, medium, and low-quality contigs (i.e.,\nputative viral contigs) Open-Reading-Frames (ORFs) were identified\nwith Prodigal-gv, a version of Prodigal modified for viral ORF identification [(https://github.com/apcamargo/prodigal-gv?tab=readme-](https://github.com/apcamargo/prodigal-gv?tab=readme-ov-file)\n\n[ov-file). Called ORFs were annotated against the pFam database](https://github.com/apcamargo/prodigal-gv?tab=readme-ov-file)\n(most recent version as of Feb 1, 2024) using hmmsearch (parameters: --notextw --noali --nobias --nseq_buffer 100,000 --nhmm_buffer 1000). The best pFam annotation (based on minimum e-value) for\neach gene was assigned. ORFs were clustered into a non-redundant\ngene catalog at 90%, 70%, 50%, and 30% identity using mmseqs2\n(V15.6f452, parameters: -c 0.9 --cov-mode 1) Antimicrobial Resistance\nGenes (ARGs) and virulence factors were identified with RGI (V6.0.3,\nparameters: \u2013low_quality, \u2013num_thresholds 4, \u2013include_nudge) using\nthe CARD database (most recent versions as of Feb 1st, 2024). We\nreport in Fig. 5 the numbers of ARGs per 10,000 reads sequenced to\naccount for variation in sequencing depth between samples.\n\nPutative viral contigs were annotated first with geNomad. Spe\ncifically, for RNA viruses used in the phylogenies in Fig. 4, we additionally implemented a BLAST approach for species-level annotation,\nmodeled directly on published methods, with code available at\n[https://github.com/snayfach/MGV/blob/master/ani_cluster/README.](https://github.com/snayfach/MGV/blob/master/ani_cluster/README.md)\n[md. Briefly, we BLASTed putative viral contigs against the RefSeq](https://github.com/snayfach/MGV/blob/master/ani_cluster/README.md)\ndatabase at the 90% identity level (using the lines and scripts provided\nin the Github Repository). We report 4 matches, as well as contig\nlengths and bitscores, in Fig. 4.\n\n#### Viral phylogeny construction\nWe additionally constructed RdRp viral trees for viruses annotated in\nthe Orthornavirae kingdom by geNomad. We used BLAST to cluster\nthe 61,557 contigs with this annotation at the 90% identity level using\nthe approach described above. This resulted in 10,446 genomes. For\neach of these, we first identified RdRp sequences using a recently\npublished database and HMMER3[,]. We took all annotations with an\ne-value under 0.01. Viral RdRp ORFs which contain hits from several\nregions were concatenated into one continuous genetic sequence per\nsample and merged into a single FASTA file. Filtering based on e-values\nresulted in a total of 8131 contigs containing putative RdRp sequences.\n\nMAFFT was used to align viral sequences. Due to the nature of\n\nviral sequence alignment, gappy regions were filtered from our alignment in this case we trimmed columns that exceeded 67% using\nTrimAI. RAxML was used to infer our phylogenetic tree using the LG\nevolutionary model with 10 starting parsimony trees and 100 bootstrap replicates in order to obtain support values for our topology.\nWhen plotting, to prune the tree and remove highly divergent viruses,\nwe removed branches in the top 5% of lengths. We additionally identified the most prevalent phylum annotation in each clade (10 nodes\nback from a given tip) and removed genomes that were outside of that\nannotation for said clade. This, combined with the length trimming,\nreduced the total number of genomes included in the tree in Fig. 4e\nto 7058.\n\nWe took the same approach for generating the tree in Fig. 4f. We\n\ntook the subset of 90% BLAST dereplicated viruses annotated as\nPisuviricota and used RAxML with the same parameters to place them\non a phylogeny. The same pruning approach was taken for tree\nvisualization.\n\n#### Analysis of pathogenic genes in wastewater\nWe filtered ORFs (unclustered) for those with pFam annotations\nwith e-values below 0.01. For each annotation, we fit an ANOVA to\n\n\nidentify those varying in prevalence (i.e., count of a given annotation in a given sample) between location types (primary/secondary schools, the wastewater treatment plant, hospital/medical\ncampus sites, the university campus basin, and dormitories). We\nonly considered annotations that had prevalences above 25\nacross all samples (9177 pFam annotations). We adjusted p-values\nwith the Benjamini\u2013Yekutieli procedure and filtered for those\nwith adjusted p-values under 0.05 (N = 4380). We then intersected\nthese significant pFam annotations with the pFam annotations\nused in the PathFam database, filtering for those annotations\nthat were significant in our analysis and, in PathFam, had a\nhypergeometric test adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 and also\noccurred in both the VFDB and Victors databases (N = 102). The\nresultant protein prevalences are visualized in Supplemen\ntary Fig. 6.\n\n#### Association between Antimicrobial Resistance Genes and hos- pital prescription data\nWe sourced monthly hospital antibiotic prescription data (per 1000\npatients) abstracted from the health system\u2019s electronic health record,\nEpic. We computed the total number of identified ARGs by month\n(overall and by the antibiotic to which a given gene conferred resistance). We took the intersection of antibiotic prescribed and genes\nannotated as having resistance to those antibiotics and computed a\nPearson correlation between the log10 counts of prescriptions and the\nnumber of genes per 10,000 sequencing reads. We removed samples\nwith fewer than 1 million reads for this analysis, as we found they\nartificially inflated the number of ARGs identified. We report raw\np-values in the figures and text. We computed and reported correlations between both hospital ARG totals as well as the other sites\nsampled.\n\n#### Additional software\nAll analysis was done in RV4.1.3. Additional packages used include:\nggtree V3.7.2, ggplot2 V3.4.2, the tidyverse V2.0.0, ComplexHeatmap V2.10.0, UpSetR V1.4.0, ComplexUpSet V1.3.3, phytools\nV1.5-1, ape V5.7-1, ggbeeswarm V0.7.1, tidytext V0.4.1, circlize\nV0.4.15, vegan V2.6-4, broom V1.0.4, reshape2 V1.4.4, and\nggpubr V0.6.0.\n\n#### Reporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\nIn compliance with the NIH RADx-rad Data Coordination Center\n(DCC) requirements, the raw sequencing data was submitted to the\nSequence Read Archive (SRA).

Along the process, multiple tools aimed to\nassess the quality and integrity of each MAG are implemented.\nNonetheless, even when incorporated within end\u2013to\u2013end pipelines,\nthe outputs of these pieces of software must be visualized and\nanalyzed manually lacking integration in a complete framework.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe developed a Nextflow pipeline (MAGFlow) for estimating the\nquality of MAGs through a wide variety of approaches (BUSCO,\nCheckM2, GUNC and QUAST), as well as for annotating taxonomically\nthe metagenomes using GTDB-Tk2. MAGFlow is coupled to a\nPython\u2013Dash application (BIgMAG) that displays the concatenated\noutcomes from the tools included by MAGFlow, highlighting the most\nimportant metrics in a single interactive environment along with a\ncomparison/clustering of the input data.\n\n**Results**\n\nBy using MAGFlow/BIgMAG, the user will be able to benchmark the\n\n\n-----\n\nMAGs obtained through different workflows or establish the quality of\nthe MAGs belonging to different samples following the divide and rule\nmethodology.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nMAGFlow/BIgMAG represents a unique tool that integrates state-ofthe-art tools to study different quality metrics and extract visually as\nmuch information as possible from a wide range of genome features.\n\n**Keywords**\nMetagenomics, Nextflow, pipeline, dashboard, data analysis.\n\n#### This article is included in the Bioinformatics\n\n gateway.\n\n\n-----\n\nIntroduction\nThe generation of metagenomics data has increased exponentially within the last ten years, supported by the rapid\nevolution of next generation sequencing techniques for both short and long reads (Tremblay et al., 2022). Moreover,\nto perform the analysis of microbiome data the usual approach involves reconstructing genomes, commonly known as\nMetagenome\u2013Assembled Genomes (MAGs), from fragmented sequences obtained during DNA extraction. The steps to\nachieve this goal enclose the cleaning and filtering out of low\u2013quality reads, the assembly of the short sequences into\nlonger and contiguous strands (contigs), plus clustering contigs into bins according to multiple genome\u2013level features\nsuch as tetranucleotide frequency, similarity in coverage, GC content, among others (Yang et al., 2021).\n\nRoutinely, the recovered MAGs, independently of the selected workflow to assemble them, should be subject to quality\nmeasurements by one or several tools. Contiguity, completeness, and contamination are regular metrics used to classify\nthe MAGs in different categories based on arbitrary criteria (Haryono et al., 2022). Common thresholds used to separate\nlow (or simply bins), mid or high\u2013quality MAGs are completeness and contamination values generated by tools such as\nCheckM or CheckM2, e.g., Bowers et al. (2017) established that high\u2013quality MAGs depict levels of contamination\nbelow 5% and completeness above 90%. For this manuscript we will use MAGs as a reference to any MAG regardless the\ncategory they should be classified in.\n\nFurthermore, given the complexity and abundance of species within some specific environments, i.e., soil or sea sources\n(Guseva et al., 2022), more sophisticated tools have been developed to detect the presence of specific marker genes,\nchimerism and duplication. In addition, proper taxonomical annotation of the MAGs allows to report unique insights\nrelated to the composition of the community, contributing to ensure the quality of the assembly and the accuracy of the\nmethods employed to bin the contigs (Cornet & Baurain, 2022).\n\nNevertheless, even though many pipelines or methodologies include one or more tools to measure the quality of the\nMAGs (Kieser et al., 2020; Krakau et al., 2022; Uritskiy et al., 2018), the visualization and/or analysis of the quality data\nrelies entirely on the user who should be familiar with the type of generated files and how to display the information in a\npleasant manner. Additionally, to take advantage of these quality\u2013measuring tools integrated into end-to-end metagenomics pipelines, the users must run the entire workflow, forcing them to carry out the analysis with a specific pipeline.\nIn other cases, the users are required to develop manually their own methodology to accomplish this important step during\nthe metagenome assembly, increasing the risk of lack of reproducibility and the difficulty to test and validate the results.\nThis scenario sets interesting challenges that encases maximizing the scope of the quality assessment, the need of\n\n\n-----\n\npipelines coupled to visualization tools and boosting reproducibility by wrapping the process with workflow managers\n(Wratten et al., 2021).\n\nAs a result, we designed a framework to measure the quality of the MAGs generated by different methodologies or\nbelonging to different samples, as well as to visualize the metrics through a web\u2013based interface. This framework carries\nout the analysis through a Nextflow pipeline (MAGFlow) that takes the MAGs as input to measure their completeness and\ncontamination using machine learning through CheckM2 (Chklovski et al., 2023), determine the level of single\u2013copy\northolog (SCO) completeness, duplication and fragmentation using BUSCO (Manni et al., 2021), estimate chimerism and\ncontamination with GUNC (Orakov et al., 2021), perform a full taxonomical classification by GTDB-Tk2 (Chaumeil\net al., 2022), and produce a full report of the assembly features by QUAST (Gurevich et al., 2013). After merging the\noutcomes from these tools, a final.tsv file is compiled by MAGFlow, and the user can use it to render an interactive web\u2013\nbased Dash application (BIgMAG).\n\nMethods\nImplementation\nMAGFlow\n\nMAGFlow is a pipeline designed to run in any environment, to be portable, easy to install, scalable to the available\ncomputational resources and ready to use in local or cloud-based infrastructures. In addition, MAGFlow can be\ncustomized through tuning parameters that are available for each tool encompassed in the workflow.\n\n[In order to assess the MAG quality and/or perform the taxonomical annotation, MAGFlow, wrapped by Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)\n[(v23.04.0), runs BUSCO (v5.7.0), CheckM2 (v1.0.1), GUNC (v1.0.6), QUAST (v5.2.0) and optionally GTDB-Tk2](https://busco.ezlab.org/)\n[(v2.4.0), along with a download of the latest Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB, current release: 220), to produce a.tsv](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/)\nfile that concatenates the outputs from these pieces of software (Figure 1). The external tools enclosed by MAGFlow are\nOpen Access, and they will remain in such status according to the license provided by their developers.\n\nAs input, the pipeline uses genomic files of the MAGs organized in corresponding folders, decompressed (.fna, .fa, .fasta)\nor compressed (.gz) obtained from a previous process of assembly/binning. Depending on the type of input, the workflow\nbegins by decompressing the files and checking if there are empty files to be removed from the analysis; the original files\nwill not be modified. Afterwards, the tools mentioned above will be run in parallel according to the allocated resources for\neach job. The taxonomical annotation is optional for each user given the high demand it represents in terms of memory\nand storage. Once all the processes are finished, MAGFlow will merge the outcomes from each tool, to end up with a\nunique final_df.tsv file, which is the main input for BIgMAG. Additionally, the pipeline will produce the regular output\nfrom each of the tools and HTML execution reports displaying the resource usage, success of each step and timestamps,\nallowing the user to explore them if required.\n\nFigure 1. MAGFlow workflow to measure the metagenome quality by different tools, annotate the MAGs\ntaxonomically and render an interactive dashboard using the output from each piece of software.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn case the user accounts with previously generated BUSCO, CheckM2, GTDB-Tk2, GUNC or QUAST files and their\naim is to use them to explore the metrics using BIgMAG, it is possible to achieve this task by just running an additional\nscript (skip_pipeline.py). This script can recognize and process the files into the required final_df.tsv by BIgMAG.\n[Directions about how to run MAGFlow or use the skip_pipeline.py script are available at https://github.com/jeffe107/](https://github.com/jeffe107/MAGFlow)\n[MAGFlow.](https://github.com/jeffe107/MAGFlow)\n\nBIgMAG\n\n[BIgMAG consists of an interactive Dash application with Plotly as the rendering engine on a regular modern web](https://dash.plotly.com/)\nbrowser. The layout is divided into 8 sections, 5 of them being plots dedicated exclusively to the tools executed by\nMAGFlow, and even though BIgMAG can theoretically handle as many samples as the user wishes, it is suggested to\ninclude only up to 15 samples per analysis to account with an organized and aesthetic application.\n\nFollowing the header, that provides a direct link to the software documentation, the dashboard depicts a bar plot summary\nfeaturing the percentages of: mid\u2013quality MAGs, high\u2013quality MAGs, MAGs passing GUNC, and if performed GTDBTk2, annotated MAGs at the specified taxonomical level and unique annotated MAGs. Moreover, using the raw the\nnumbers (not percentages) of the previously described variables, BIgMAG shows the p\u2013value of a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, a\nnon-parametric statistical test designed to compare two or more groups that allows the study of samples with different\nsize, does not require data with the same underlying distribution and can include several response variables. This p\u2013value\nwill be displayed in red when it is lower than the most used threshold for this kind of test, 0.05; however, each user should\nanalyze the significance of this value since in some cases the user may be expecting no difference among the samples,\npipelines or binners.\n\nBelow the Kruskal\u2013Wallis p\u2013value result, a heatmap is presented showing the output of a post\u2013hoc test congruent with the\nKruskal\u2013Wallis method to rank the data, the Duncan test, comparing the raw numbers of the same variables analyzed with\nthe Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. It is worthy to mention that the Duncan test is always performed and its results are displayed\nregardless the p\u2013value of the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. Further, the user may want to expand their data analysis with different\nstatistical methods.\n\nFollowing the summary section, to present CheckM2 and BUSCO results, scatterplots are used to depict the behavior of\ngenome completeness against contamination levels and complete SCO versus duplicated SCO for CheckM2 and\nBUSCO, respectively. Moreover, the results from QUAST and GUNC are displayed through boxplots that show the\ndistribution of the data according to a user\u2013selected parameter. The QUAST plot includes the p\u2013value of a Welch\nANOVA test among samples for the chosen parameter; this type of ANOVA is performed given that if the number of\nMAGs per sample is uneven, the possibility of violating the homogeneity of variances assumption is increased. Similar to\nthe Kruskal\u2013Wallis p\u2013value displayed in the summary section, if the p\u2013value is lower than 0.05, it is going to be depicted\nin red. As discussed previously, the user is in charge of the interpretation of such value depending if they are in the search\nfor significant differences or not among samples, pipelines or binners.\n\nTo process the outcomes from GTDB-Tk2, BIgMAG generates a presence/absence matrix representation of annotated\ntaxa at the taxonomical level specified by the user, in a different strategy to extract important data without showing the\ncomplete phylogeny of the annotated MAGs. In brief, to create this plot, the summary table generated by GTDB-Tk2 is\nused to map each taxonomical group annotated by this tool against every sample, displaying, as a result, only if a\ndetermined organism at the user-selected rank is present or not in each sample. This approach is valuable in terms\nof the simplicity it achieves to display this type of information, providing an alternative to the time\u2013consuming\nbranch\u2013collapsing methodology that is usually followed through specialized software packages, e.g., iTOL (Letunic\n& Bork, 2021), as shown by Bayer et al. (2020) to condensate the GTDB-Tk2 output.\n\nFollowing the GTDB-Tk2 plot, a cluster heatmap is displayed, in which the samples are clustered based on their similarity\nusing different parameters provided by BUSCO, CheckM2, GUNC and/or GTDB-Tk2. To render this plot, average\nvalues are used, combined with the proportion of MAGs passing the GUNC test and/or the proportion of annotated MAGs\nby GTDB-Tk2.\n\nAt the bottom of the dashboard, the raw data in table format is displayed with the possibility for the user of highlighting\ncells, deleting rows and filtering the columns with keywords.\n\nComplementary to each plot, there is a series of callbacks that exploits the native interactivity of Plotly and Dash. These\ncallbacks allow filtering out the MAGs according to contamination and completeness threshold levels in the CheckM2\n\n\n-----\n\nplot, or based on complete SCO and duplicated SCO in the case of the BUSCO figure, selecting the parameter to display\nthe data distribution of each sample in GUNC or QUAST plots and zooming in/out in the GTDB-Tk2 plot by selecting the\nnumber of samples to show. Also, it is possible to store all the figures individually directly from the dashboard with the in\u2013\nbuilt function to download the plots locally. More interactive details will be displayed when the cursor hovers each of the\nplot zones, i.e., on CheckM2 or BUSCO scatterplots, if GTDB-Tk2 data is found in the final_df.tsv file, the taxonomical\nclassification will be also included in the information depicted.\n\nBIgMAG also features the possibility of being compiled as an HTML webpage to be displayed afterwards without\nrequiring any of the processing components installed. However, given that this is not a native feature of Dash, the\ncallbacks cannot be used while the dashboard is stored. Therefore, we developed an additional script (app_lite.py), a lite\nversion of BIgMAG, displaying the same layout as the regular version, although with an additional Save to html button\nbelow the heading section, and without the components triggering the callbacks. This lite version of BIgMAG can be\n[customized and adjusted by using command line arguments (tutorial available at the repository https://github.com/](https://github.com/jeffe107/BIgMAG)\n[jeffe107/BIgMAG).](https://github.com/jeffe107/BIgMAG)\n\nOperation\nMAGFlow/BIgMAG is performed on UNIX-based operating systems, e.g., any Linux distribution or macOS; its\n[operation on Windows 10 or 11 is also possible through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). Specifically, MAGFlow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)\n[demands the installation of Nextflow (\u226523.04.0), which in turn requires Java JDK 17 or 19 (recommended version](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)\n[17.0.3). In addition, it is necessary to account with a software management tool such as Conda (\u226523.3.1), Mamba](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)\n[(\u22651.3.1) or any container technology including Docker, Singularity, Apptainer, Podman or Charliecloud. After fulfilling](https://www.docker.com/)\nthese requirements, the user can start the analysis with MAGFlow by providing the directory path where the MAG files\nare stored or a.csv file indicating the different file paths. A terminal example command can be as follows:\n\n\nnextflow run MAGFlow/main.nf -profile apptainer --files '~/samples/*' --outdir.\n\n\nOr:\n\n\nnextflow run MAGFlow/main.nf -profile apptainer \u2013-csv_file '~/samples.csv'\n--outdir.\n\n\nThe -profile argument must be set according to the software management tool the system user incorporates, and the\npath to store the output files is completely arbitrary to the user. Details in regard to the required MAG file structure, an\n[example of the .csv datasheet, and other configuration options can be found at https://github.com/jeffe107/MAGFlow.](https://github.com/jeffe107/MAGFlow)\n\nWith the aim of providing specific support, MAGFlow has been tested under the system configurations presented in\nTable 1.\n\nTable 1.

Also, the impacts of performing hybrid assembly (Illumina and PacBio) were evaluated by\nbuilding MAGs from the same mock community with MUFFIN and nf\u2013core/mag (nf_core_mag_hybrid) (van Damme\net al., 2021; Krakau et al., 2022). Additionally, in order to establish the same starting point for all the pipelines processing\nonly short reads, Megahit (Li et al., 2016) was set as assembly software. In the case of hybrid assembly pipelines, SPAdes\n(Nurk et al., 2017) executed the assembly step for both workflows since Megahit does not account with such feature.\nFurther, MetaBAT2 (Kang et al., 2019) was selected as the binning tool for all the pipelines studied in this section,\nexcluding DATMA since this workflow follows a different strategy to recover the MAGs that groups first the reads using\na specific approach called CLAME (Benavides et al., 2018), to assemble them in batches afterwards.\n\nThe results obtained by MAGFlow and displayed by BIgMAG for this experiment highlight how pipelines\nprovide similar results notwithstanding they account with different workflow managers. This is the case for MetaWRAP,\nnf_core_mag_short, ATLAS and SnakeMAGs since their quality metrics were similar and the Duncan test did not show\nsignificant differences among them (Figure 2a,b). However, only MUFFIN exhibited significant differences against\nDATMA considering the parameters the test includes, namely number of: mid\u2013quality or high\u2013quality MAGs (using\nCheckM2 values), MAGs passing GUNC, annotated MAGs at the specified taxonomical level and unique annotated\nMAGs (GTDB-Tk2) (Figure 2b).\n\nTable 2.

Plots generated by BIgMAG depicting the outputs from different tools used to estimate the quality\nand annotate taxonomically the MAGs recovered from a sequenced mock community: a) bar plot summary of\ndifferent features (see main text) per pipeline, b) p\u2013value matrix of the Duncan test comparing every pipeline\nagainst each other, c) distribution of the number of contigs per MAG obtained by each pipeline, d) data\ndistribution of the CSS per pipeline filtered out by MAGs passing GUNC test, e) presence/absence matrix\nrepresentation depicting annotated taxa in each pipeline at species level and f) cluster heatmap of the\npipelines in function of their average values for different parameters.\n\n\n-----\n\nLikewise, the p\u2013value from the Welch ANOVA performed for the variable Number of contigs in the QUAST plot\nindicates significant differences (taking into account a threshold of 0.005) among the pipelines in regard to this parameter,\nbeing probably MUFFIN, DATMA and nf_core_mag_hybrid the pipelines that contributed to the significant obtained\np\u2013value (0.0056) (Figure 2c).\n\nAnother important aspect to consider to compare the pipeline performance is the Clade Separation Score (CSS) calculated\nby GUNC, a metric that indicates the level of taxonomical chimerism in each contig of a MAG, where MetaWRAP,\nATLAS, nf_core_mag_short and SnakeMAGs show a more uniform data distribution of the CSS values belonging to the\nMAGs that passed the GUNC test (Figure 2d).\n\nRegarding the taxonomical annotation at species level, it is noticeable that DATMA is not as effective to recover the\ngenomes from the mock community as the rest of the workflows, remaining the main proportion of these unannotated\n(Figure 2e). Also, MUFFIN outcomes indicate an enhancement in the recovery of less abundant genomes by performing a\nhybrid assembly with short and long read technologies, since species such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Cutibacterium\nacnes, Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis were only detected by this pipeline; this improvement achieved by\nhybrid assemblies has been proved by Tao et al. (2023) and Liew et al. (2024). Nevertheless, this was not the case for\nnf_core_mag_hybrid, since it did not show a remarkably superior outcome compared to nf_core_mag_short in regards of\nextra species annotated or number of MAGs, although nf_core_mag_hybrid provided a ~20% increase in the proportion\nof high\u2013quality MAGs and a higher percentage ~30% of MAGs passing GUNC test (Figure 2a).\n\nAs a result, the observations afore-mentioned contribute to the pipeline grouping displayed in the cluster heatmap, in\nwhich the metrics of the outcomes from MetaWRAP seem to be closer to the values obtained with ATLAS, and more\ndissimilar from the cluster that encompasses nf\u2013core/mag (short and hybrid) and SnakeMAGs; MUFFIN and DATMA\nrepresent the most different workflows in regard to the quality features depicted by the MAGs assembled with these\npipelines (Figure 2f).\n\nIn terms of performance, MAGFlow ( v1.0.0) takes approximately 18 minutes to analyze the MAGs obtained from the\nmock community on an HPC cluster with 128 CPUs and 500 GB of available memory using the local executor and the\n[default configuration that can be found on the file MAGFlow/conf/base.config at the repository (https://github.com/](https://github.com/jeffe107/MAGFlow)\n[jeffe107/MAGFlow). Downloading the GTDB-Tk2 database can take up to 4 hours, while retrieving the GUNC database](https://github.com/jeffe107/MAGFlow)\ntakes ~1 hour depending on the bandwidth of the user Internet network.\n\nIn order to show another example of the utility of MAGFlow/BIgMAG (v1.0.0), we used nf\u2013core/mag to recover MAGs\nfrom several public metagenomics datasets generated from different crop rhizospheres or soil including rice, wheat and\nmaize (Table 2). Additionally, two modes of assembly and binning were considered, namely SASB as single assembly/\nsingle binning and CACB as co-assembly/co-binning. Considering the intensive computational demands by the\nco-assembly process, only Megahit was used as assembly software and MetaBAT2 as the binning tool, allowing the\nsame experimental setting for both SASB and CACB modes. Besides, the raw reads were previously cleaned using fastp\n(Chen et al., 2018), and a host removal was performed with bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012), indexing the proper\nhost genome according to the type of crop the samples were obtained from. The NCBI RefSeq assembly accession\n[numbers of the host genomes used to map the corresponding reads are GCF_018294505.1 (wheat), GCF_000005425.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_018294505.1/)\n[(rice) and GCF_902167145.1 (maize).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_902167145.1/)\n\nAfterwards, the MAGs retrieved under each condition were used as input for MAGFlow/BIgMAG, and leveraging on\nthese outcomes it is possible to notice how CACB allowed to recover a higher number of MAGs in the case of maize and\nrice, and this pipeline setting also enabled the possibility to have at least 1 MAG with mid\u2013quality for wheat and maize\n(Figure 3a,b). Nonetheless, nor the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test (p\u2013value = 0.25455 considering MAGs annotated at genus level)\nnor the Duncan test showed significant differences among the samples using SASB or CACB if considered a threshold\nvalue of 0.05; this kind of scenario is not necessarily negative since in some cases the user could be studying samples from\nthe same matrix throughout time in which it is desirable to account with a stable and permanent communities without\ndifferences among them.\n\nOn the other hand, taking into account the overall outcomes of this sample analysis, MAGFlow/BIgMAG underlines the\nadvantages CACB permits by increasing both the quality and the number of MAGs obtained per type of assembly. This is\nsupported by the higher proportion of annotated MAGs at genus levels for all soil/rhizosphere samples treated under\nCACB mode (Figure 3c). These observations can even lead to cluster samples assembled under CACB in the same group\nwhen they belong to different matrices (Figure 3d). Similar outcomes have been published by Vosloo et al. (2021) during\nexperiments set with this type of operational mode, fixing metaSPAdes as assembler and MetaBAT2 as binning software.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Results of the experiment to explore the recovered MAGs by nf\u2013core/mag from different soil/\nrhizosphere samples using MAGFlow/BIgMAG: a) bar plot summary of different features (see main text)\nper sample, b) scatterplot of the completeness level against contamination portion of mid\u2013quality MAGs,\nc) presence/absence matrix representation depicting annotated taxa in each sample at genus level and\nd) cluster heatmap of the samples in function of their average values for different parameters. The names of\nthe samples are represented by merging the origin of the sample (rice, wheat or maize) and the mode used by the\npipeline to obtain the MAGs (SASB or CACB).\n\n\n-----\n\nLikewise, when the rice samples were assembled and binned under CACB mode, a higher number of MAGs was\nobtained, compared to wheat and maize samples, even though all the co-assemblies accounted with a similar number of\nreads (sequencing depth). This situation highlights how the sequencing depth is not the single factor affecting the\nassembly process and stresses the need to consider how additional conditions can influence the results such as the error\nrate of the sequencing method, the complexity of soil/rhizosphere samples, and the read length (Sims et al., 2014).\n\nFurther, the co-assembly of the rice soil samples (PRJNA663614) generated by nf\u2013core/mag was used to build MAGs\nusing MetaBinner (Wang et al., 2023) and SemiBin (Pan et al., 2023) in their default configurations, benchmarking them\nagainst the performance of MetaBAT2 (the version included in nf\u2013core/mag). By these means, the MAG quality metrics\n[of different binning tools were analyzed using MAGFlow/BIgMAG (v1.1.0); the outcomes are presented in Figure 4.](https://github.com/jeffe107/MAGFlow/releases/tag/releasev1.1)\nFrom these results, it is noticeable how using the same assembly MetaBinner recovered a higher number of MAGs, and\nhence reporting genera that nor SemiBin nor MetaBAT2 were able to reconstruct (Figure 4a,c). Nonetheless, although\nMetaBinner produces a greater number of MAGs, the quality of these is low, given that only two of the 25 MAGs from\n\nFigure 4. MAGFlow/BIgMAG results of the in-silico benchmarking of MAGs obtained through several tools\nusing a single co-assembly of rice soil samples: a) bar plot summary of different features (see main text)\nper sample, b) scatterplot of the completeness level against contamination portion of mid\u2013quality MAGs,\nc) presence/absence matrix representation depicting annotated taxa in each sample at genus level,\nd) dispersion of the MAGs according to the presence of complete and duplicated SCO and e) distribution of\nthe number of contigs per MAG obtained by each binner.\n\n\n-----\n\nMetaBinner falls into the mid\u2013quality category (Figure 4b); outcomes in the same line are depicted by the BUSCO plot,\nsince only 5 MAGs depict at least 30% of SCO with less than 5% of these SCO duplicated (Figure 4d).\n\nOn the other hand, the p\u2013value of the Welch ANOVA for the variable Number of contigs per MAG depicts a significant\ndifference among the binners, from which it is noteworthy that SemiBin groups a lower number of contigs to generate\neach MAG (Figure 4e).\n\nDiscussion\nThe strategy MAGFlow uses to perform the analysis attempts to follow the nf\u2013core guidelines (P. A. Ewels et al., 2020),\n[which allows robustness and reproducibility, and it has been tested using nf\u2013test. This is supported by its Nextflow](https://www.nf-test.com/)\nwrapping, along with its great performance features such as the possibility to run the software independently and in\nparallel, the chance to couple it to many other Nextflow modules or pipelines and the property to be scalable and adjusted\nto the available resources on the system user (Di Tommaso et al., 2017). MAGFlow can also be implemented through a\nwide variety of profiles such as Conda, Mamba, Docker, Singularity and Apptainer, which increases the scope of suitable\nsystems to execute it. In addition, the pipeline can be launched in local environments, HPC clusters featuring executors as\nSLURM or SGE, or cloud\u2013based solutions such as Azure Batch or AWS Batch (native Nextflow functionality not tested\nfor MAGFlow).\n\nAt the moment of writing this report, another specific workflow (GENcontams.nf) to measure the quality of MAGs\nthrough multiple tools is available, which is part of the GEN\u2013ERA toolbox (Cornet et al., 2022). Among the advantages of\nthis package, we can enumerate the inclusion of tools that MAGFlow currently lacks, such as Physeter, Kraken2 and\nEukCC, the wide control the user can apply over the parameters to run the software, as well as the integration with the\nGEN\u2013ERA suite. Nonetheless, GENcontams.nf is written under Nextflow DSL1, which is no longer supported by the\ndevelopers, it does not incorporate a visualization module, and it is not modularized, meaning that all of the analysis are\nperformed in a single script. This single-script configuration increases the difficulty to track and monitor the pipeline\nexecution, disables the feature to resume the pipeline given the lack of checkpoints, and limits the possibility to couple it\nto nf\u2013core pipelines. Besides, GENcontams.nf does not perform the taxonomical annotation with GTDB-Tk2, leaving\nthis task to a different module within the GEN\u2013ERA toolbox.\n\nAnother pipeline called Metaphor (Salazar et al., 2022) can provide important and informative quality metrics and plots of\nthe reconstructed MAGs by comparing the performance of different binning software (VAMB, MetaBAT2, CONCOT),\nmainly through bin scores calculated by DAS Tool (Sieber et al., 2018). However, some limitations could be pointed out:\nthe restriction of this analysis only to the binning software enclosed by the workflow, the requirement of running the entire\npipeline from the raw reads and the generation of static image plots that are not possible to be customized or further\nexplored.\n\nOn the other hand, in terms of visualization and portability of the plots, MultiQC (Ewels et al., 2016) represents the most\nused and widespread visualization tool, commonly included in several metagenomics pipelines that has eased the process\nof output integration from several pieces of software; however, out of the tools implemented in MAGFlow, MultiQC only\naccounts with support for QUAST and BUSCO data obtained from their execution elsewhere.\n\nMAGFlow/BIgMAG attempts to bypass these limitations in the field of metagenomics data analysis given the\nreproducibility and scalability of its workflow to assess the quality of the MAGs. Likewise, our tool accounts with\ndiverse functionalities including taxonomic classification, visualization of assembly metrics and the estimation of\nstructural integrity. Not only the advantages of MAGFlow/BIgMAG are reflected on the scientific scope, but also in\npractical terms since it accounts with a modularized Nextflow architecture to enclose the software tools and the easiness to\nanalyze different types of input and several MAG folders (recommended up to 15) in a single run. Additionally, BIgMAG\ncomplements MAGFlow by generating high\u2013quality automatic plots for all the encompassed tools, allowing a high\ndegree of interactivity and customization according to the user needs. As a result, MAGFlow/BIgMAG represents a\nunique tool to our knowledge that integrates the execution of the software with a visualization module to extract MAG\nquality information and taxonomical annotation, featuring MAGFlow/BIgMAG as a helpful piece of software when\ntargeting comparisons among different metagenomics pipelines or tools to bin contigs.\n\nFurthermore, MAGFlow/BIgMAG can be useful during the execution of studies aimed to detect the presence of MAG\nhidden contamination after the binning step. For instance, our tool could automatize part of the work during the analysis of\nthe effects of multi\u2013coverage metagenomic binning (Mattock & Watson, 2023), since some of the tools used in such study\nto measure the MAG quality and perform taxonomical annotation are also enclosed by MAGFlow/BIgMAG.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, MAGFlow/BIgMAG provides a convenient support during exploratory analyses that involve establishing general\ndifferences across samples as we showed with the examples presented in this paper.\n\nFinally, following the principle of divide\u2013and\u2013rule proposed by Lupo et al. (2021), which suggests that genome quality\nand contamination should be assessed with as many different tools as possible, MAGFlow/BIgMAG scope will be\ncontinuously expanded through the inclusion of additional tools, such as DAS Tool, Kraken2, Physeter, EukCC, among\nothers.\n\nData availability\nThe raw sequencing data to test MAGFlow/BIgMAG were retrieved from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and they\ncan be accessed through the following identifiers:\n\nSequence Read Archive: NextSeq500 of rice rhizosphere soil: Francis booting rep1.

Here, we describe a\ncomprehensive genomic dataset from the first individual, HG008, including\nDNA from an adherent, epithelial-like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) tumor cell line and matched normal cells from duodenal and\npancreatic tissues. Data for the tumor-normal matched samples comes from\nthirteen distinct state-of-the-art whole genome measurement technologies,\nincluding high depth short and long-read bulk whole genome sequencing\n(WGS), single cell WGS, and Hi-C, and karyotyping. These data will be used\nby the GIAB Consortium to develop matched tumor-normal benchmarks for\nsomatic variant detection. We expect these data to facilitate innovation for\nwhole genome measurement technologies, de novo assembly of tumor and\nnormal genomes, and bioinformatic tools to identify small and structural\nsomatic mutations. This first-of-its-kind broadly consented open-access\nresource will facilitate further understanding of sequencing methods used for\ncancer biology.\n\n# Background & Summary\n\nThe GIAB Consortium has previously developed extensive sequencing data\nand benchmarks for seven normal human cell lines, which are used in\n[technology development and validation of clinical assays.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/mhlzb+4MMEN) While some\n[tumor cell lines have been characterized as benchmarks,](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/mCqTi+dqa3H+MWsCT+MponX) these data are\nfrom legacy cell lines with no consent or consent before whole genome\nsequencing was routine. In 2013, NIH determined that researchers could\npublicly share genomic data from legacy cancer cell lines in the Cancer Cell\nLine Encyclopedia despite having no or limited consent, because most of\nthese cell lines already had public genomic data available\n[(https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/history/polici](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/history/policies/ccle-open-release-justification.pdf)\n[es/ccle-open-release-justification.pdf). However, the policy states that it](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/history/policies/ccle-open-release-justification.pdf)\ncould be revised in the future, and it \u201cstrongly recommended that informed\nconsent processes for prospective research development of human cell lines\n(for research or commercial purposes) fully describe and consider any risks\nassociated with broad distribution of genomic data derived from those cell\nlines.\u201d Therefore, there is a need for new tumor-normal pairs with explicit\nconsent for public dissemination of genome sequencing data and cell lines,\nso that they can be developed into enduring reference samples for\n[benchmarking somatic variants.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/q39pE)\n\nTo meet this need, we describe a comprehensive dataset of whole\ngenome-scale measurements, including extensive short and long-read\nsequencing, from a new immortal PDAC cell line and paired normal\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\npancreatic and duodenal tissues, derived from a female of European genetic\nancestry with explicit consent for public release of genomic data. We will\nmake additional data and benchmarks available as they are generated. We\nare also actively working to deposit the cell line in a public repository. Links to\nthese resources will be posted on the NIST Cancer Genome in a Bottle\n[webpage: https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/cancer-genome-bottle.](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/cancer-genome-bottle)\n\n# Methods\n\n## Pancreatic cancer patient with explicit consent for genomic data sharing\n\nThe GIAB Consortium requires explicit consent for genomic data sharing for\nits widely-used cell lines, NIST is collaborating with the Liss Laboratory at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH)\n[(https://www.massgeneral.org/surgery/gastrointestinal-and-oncologic-surger](https://www.massgeneral.org/surgery/gastrointestinal-and-oncologic-surgery/research/liss-laboratory)\n[y/research/liss-laboratory) to develop matched tumor-normal cell lines. The](https://www.massgeneral.org/surgery/gastrointestinal-and-oncologic-surgery/research/liss-laboratory)\nLiss Lab operates the Pancreatic Tumor Bank at MGH. MGH recruited\nparticipants, performed tissue collection and attempted to develop matched\ntumor-normal cell lines from the resected tissues (though normal cell line\ndevelopment was unsuccessful for the participant (GIAB ID: HG008) from\nwhich data is presented in this manuscript). The participants have been\nexplicitly consented for tissue collection and public genomic data sharing\nfollowing an MGH IRB-approved protocol (see relevant excerpt from the\nconsent below). The MGH Data and Tissue Sharing Committee and NIST\nResearch Protections Office determined that the signed consent allows for\nsharing of the participants' genomic data and development and distribution\nof cell lines as reference materials.\n\n### Consent excerpt for sharing genomic data and cell line\n\nFor transparency, we include the parts of the MGH IRB-approved consent\nrelevant to public sharing of genomic data, creation of the immortalized cell\nline, and public sharing of the cell line below:\n\n\u201cWe plan to do genetic research on the DNA in your tissue sample. DNA is\nthe material that makes up your genes. All living things are made of cells.\nGenes are the part of cells that contain the instructions which tell our bodies\nhow to grow and work, and determine physical characteristics such as hair\nand eye color. Genes are passed from parent to child.\u201d\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n\u201cYour tissue sample may be used to create living tissue samples (including\ncell lines) that can be grown in the laboratory. This allows researchers to have\nan unlimited supply of your cells in the future without asking for more\nsamples from you. The living tissue samples will be shared with the\nacademic, non-profit research, and for-profit communities. Cancer\nresearchers will use these living tissue samples to study better ways to detect\nand treat cancer. Companies may use the living tissue samples to develop\nproducts that are used to improve the detection and treatment of cancer to\nbenefit patients. The living tissue samples will be sent with the random\nnumber corresponding to your original tissue and will not be sent with\nidentifiable health information.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour cells might be used in research involving genetic alteration of the cells.\nYour cells might be mixed with other human cells, mixed with animal cells, or\ngrown in lab animals like mice. We may also perform a whole genome\nanalysis on the DNA from your clinical samples and living tissue samples.\nUsually researchers study just a few areas of your genetic code that are\nlinked to a disease or condition. In whole genome studies, all or most of your\ngenes are analyzed and used by researchers to study links to many diseases\nor conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to allow researchers to share test results, the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) and other central repositories have developed data (information)\nbanks that analyze data and collect the results of whole genome studies.\nThese banks may also analyze and store DNA samples, as well. These central\nbanks will store your genetic information and samples and make them\navailable to the public for additional studies. Because the DNA sequence is\navailable on a database, it is possible that someone using the sequence\ncould identify the donor and possible relatives. The samples and data will be\nsent with only your code number attached. Your name or other directly\nidentifiable information will not be given to central banks. There are many\nsafeguards in place to protect your information and samples while they are\nstored in repositories and used for research.\u201d\n\n\u201cResearch using your samples, living tissue samples, and their whole genome\ninformation is important for the study of virtually all diseases and conditions.\nTherefore, the sample/data banks will provide study data for researchers\nworking on any disease.\u201d\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n## HG008 patient history\n\nThis dataset is for the first tumor cell line developed from an MGH participant\n(GIAB ID: HG008). The individual, known by the GIAB as HG008, was a\n61-year-old with XX sex chromosomes who was diagnosed with pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma (disease stage ypT2 N1). Resection of PDAC tumor,\nduodenal tissue, and pancreatic tissue was performed at MGH in December\n2020 and sent to the Liss laboratory for tissue banking. After neoadjuvant\ntherapy, the greatest dimension of the tumor was 3.2 cm, located in the\npancreatic head near the duodenum. The histologic grade was G2\n(moderately differentiated), and the tumor regression grade was 2 (Minimal\nresponse: Residual cancer outgrown by fibrosis).\n\n## Establishing the HG008-T tumor cell line\n\nThe Liss laboratory established a PDAC tumor cell line (HG008-T) from the\nresected PDAC tumor. PDAC tumors are stromal-rich, with cancer cells often\nonly composing 10 % of the tumor. Approximately 50 mg of tumor tissue\nwas enzymatically dissociated to begin culturing from the primary tumor cells\nfor cell line development. While PDAC cell cultures often contain substantial\nfibroblasts, in this case all cells appeared to be epithelial-like tumor cells even\nat passage 2 for this cell line. Cells were cultured for the first 20 passages\nusing \"Rich\" media composed of DMEM/F12 with 20 % Fetal Bovine Serum\n(FBS), Nicotinamide (0.01 M), cholera toxin (8.4 ng/mL), Epidermal Growth\nFactor (EGF; 10 ng/mL), Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF: 25 ng/mL), human\nrecombinant insulin (10 ug/mL), human recombinant transferrin (5.5 ug/mL),\nand selenious acid (6.7 ng/mL). Cells were enzymatically removed from the\nculture surface using 0.25 % trypsin and split by diluting no more than 1:3 for\nthe first 20 passages. Passages 21-24 were diluted 1:3 and grown in the\nsame media as prior passages however without EGF. Morphologically pure\ncancer cell cultures, free of tumor-associated fibroblasts, were considered\ncell lines after growing for at least 20 passages. From passage 25 on, the\nestablished cell line was then cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10 % FBS. All\nmedia contained 1 % antibiotic/antimycotic.\n\nOnce the cell line was established, a large homogenous batch (batch\n0823p23) of tumor cells was cultured and at passage 23, approximately 80\nmillion tumor cells were harvested, pelleted and snap-frozen for distribution\nand measurement of non-viable cells. Tumor cell line pellets, or isolated DNA\nfrom the pellets, and non-viable paired normal tissue, or isolated DNA from\nthe tissue, were distributed for genome-scale measurements as described in\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 2 and Supplementary Table 1. In addition to measurements from the\nlarge, homogeneous batch of tumor cells, we also performed karyotyping on\np31, Illumina WGS on p36, and Phase Genomics Hi-C on p38, all derived\nfrom the same series of passages starting with the p13 stock that batch\n0823p23 was grown from. Passage 13 of the tumor cell line was transferred\nto NIST in summer of 2024 and preliminary measurements of NIST passages\np18 and p21 are also presented (Figure 1).\n\n**Figure 1 HG008 Passaging and Measurements. The PDAC tumor and normal**\nduodenal and pancreatic tissues were resected from the HG008 individual in\n2020. The HG008-T cell line was established by MGH and a bulk growth of\ntumor cells was produced for most measurements. This bulk growth and\nharvest is known as batch 0823p23. Tumor and normal samples were sent for\nmeasurements on multiple technologies denoted by the colored ovals; empty\novals are where no corresponding measurement was made. To characterize\nthe HG008-T cell line during passaging, preliminary measurements were\nmade and noted below the passage points denoted by \u201cp#\u201d. In 2024, an\naliquot of the cell line was transferred to NIST by MGH for additional culturing\nand measurements.\n\n## HG008 paired normal tissues\n\nFor the HG008 participant, the laboratory attempted to create an\nEBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line from frozen PBMCs, but this was\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nunsuccessful. However, several hundred milligrams of normal pancreatic\n(HG008-N-P) and duodenal (HG008-N-D) tissue was resected, allowing for\nmatched normal sample measurements. These normal sample measurements\nare primarily to help identify somatic variants in the tumor, but also could be\nuseful for mosaic variant detection within the tissues.\n\n## Tumor and normal samples for measurement\n\nTumor and normal samples required genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation prior to\nmeasurement. In some cases measurement sites chose to perform their own\nDNA isolation, however, others preferred to receive isolated gDNA. The\nsamples the measurement sites received, either DNA, cells or tissue, are\nnoted in Table 2. For sites receiving gDNA, isolations from non-viable cell\npellets of the tumor cell line (batch 0823p23), non-viable normal duodenal\ntissue and non-viable pancreatic tissue were performed by the Genome\nTechnology laboratory at Northeastern University and distributed to the\nmeasurement sites. Methods for measurement sites that performed their\n\nown DNA isolations are provided with their measurement methods in the\nGenome-scale measurements methods section. For sites receiving gDNA,\nmethods for normal tissue and tumor cell line gDNA isolations are provided\nbelow and referenced in Genome-scale measurement methods as \u201cpreviously\nisolated genomic DNA.\u201d\n\n### Genomic DNA isolation from normal tissues\n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from two normal tissue types, non-viable\npancreatic (HG008-N-P) and duodenal (HG008-N-D), using the Qiagen\nPuregene Tissue Kit (PN: 158667). Approximately 2 mL of Qiagen kit cell lysis\nbuffer with 30 uL of Proteinase K was added to 10-15 mg of tissue. A Dounce\nHomogenizer was used to disrupt the tissue before leaving it overnight at\n55\u2103. This was followed by addition of RNase A and another incubation at\n37\u2103 for 5 minutes followed by cooling on ice. Genomic DNA was\nprecipitated, washed and hydrated in TE buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris\u00b7Cl\npH 7.5) per the Qiagen Puregene protocol. Two separate isolations were\nperformed for each tissue type and resulting gDNA pooled for each tissue\ntype. For QC, the isolating laboratory measured the yield of gDNA by Qubit\nand read N50 of gDNA with ONT sequencing. Further, sites performing\nlong-read sequencing independently assessed the gDNA prior to use. Yield,\nread N50 and sizing are summarized in Table 1. Isolated gDNA from the\npaired normal tissues was then distributed to various sites for genome-scale\nmeasurements as described in Table 2.\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from non-viable cell pellets of the\n0823p23 batch of cells from the HG008-T tumor cell line using the Qiagen\nPuregene Cell Kit (PN: 158767). Approximately five million cells were input\ninto the Qiagen Puregene protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed, treated with\nRNase, gDNA precipitated, washed and hydrated in TE buffer (1 mM EDTA,\n10 mM Tris\u00b7Cl pH 7.5). The gDNA was viscous and was therefore allowed to\nhomogenize for one week at ambient laboratory temperature. Yield of gDNA\nwas measured by Qubit. N50 of gDNA isolated from the tissues was\nestimated with ONT sequencing and described in Table 1. Isolated genomic\nDNA from the 0823p23 batch of HG008-T cells was then distributed to\nvarious sites for genome-scale measurements as described in Table 2.\n\n\n**Table 1 Batch genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation for distribution. DNA isolations**\nfrom the three samples were performed for distribution to laboratories for\nmeasurement. Isolated DNA was sent to several sites for genome-scale\nmeasurements as described in Table 2. To confirm gDNA was fit for purpose,\nyield and length of gDNA was measured at different sites prior to use. Sizing\nand N50 reported are approximated values from three measurement sites.\nGenomic DNA yield from normal tissues for the separate isolations is noted in\nparentheses. Two sizing measurements are given for sites that measured\nsizing, prior to their measurements.\n\n### Genomic DNA isolation from the tumor cell line\n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from non-viable cell pellets of the\n0823p23 batch of cells from the HG008-T tumor cell line using the Qiagen\nPuregene Cell Kit (PN: 158767). Approximately five million cells were input\ninto the Qiagen Puregene protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed, treated with\nRNase, gDNA precipitated, washed and hydrated in TE buffer (1 mM EDTA,\n\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\n## Genome-scale measurements of HG008 tumor and normal samples\n\nExtensive genomic measurements were performed for all HG008 samples;\nHG008-T, HG008-N-D and HG008-N-P (Figure 1). Here we present twenty\nGIAB HG008 whole genome-scale datasets. Measurements were performed\nwith thirteen collaborating laboratories representing thirteen distinct\nmeasurement technologies (see summary in Table 2 and full description in\nSupplementary Table 1). The measurement methods presented below\ninclude samples measured (HG008-T, HG008-N-P and/or HG008-N-D), DNA\nisolation, sample preparation, measurement process and validation, as\nappropriate for the measurement.\n\n**Table 2 Summary of measurements made for HG008 tumor and normal**\nsamples. Sample fields denote the starting material received by the\n\nmeasurement institution; cells, tissue or isolated genomic DNA. Tumor\nsamples derive from either a large, homogeneous batch of cells distributed in\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n2023 (0823p23) by the Liss lab at MGH, from a series of 2022 Liss lab\npassages starting with the p13 stock that batch 0823p23 was grown from or\nfrom NIST passages in 2024.\n\n### Bulk short-read whole genome sequencing\n\n Illumina NovaSeq 6000\n\n**PCR-free 2x150 bp Illumina Sequencing (Dataset ID: ILMN-PCR-free-1)**\n\nDNA Isolation\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from approximately 10 million non-viable\nHG008-T cells (passage 36 from 2022 culture) and 80 mg of non-viable\nHG008-N-P tissue with the Qiagen Gentra Puregene kit using the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instruction. Genomic DNA mass yields for tumor and normal\nsamples were approximately 26 and 9 ug, respectively. Resulting DNA size\nwas quantified using the PicoGreen Assay (Quant-iT\u2122PicoGreen\u2122,\ncatalog# P11496) and the quality was assessed using 1 % agarose gel\n(Invitrogen\u2122E-Gel\u2122Agarose Gels, catalog# G720801).\n\nLibrary Preparation\nLibrary preparation was performed for each sample using an in-house\nPCR-free protocol, with the Roche Kapa HyperPrep PCR-free Kit (PN:\nKK8505). Two libraries were prepared for the tumor from 1 ug of gDNA for\neach library and one library was prepared for the normal duodenal sample\nfrom 1 ug of gDNA. For both tumor and normal samples, DNA was sheared\ninto fragments of approximately 450 to 600 bp using a Covaris E220 system.\nFragmentation was followed by purification of the fragmented DNA using\ndouble-sided bead clean up with different ratios of AMPure XP beads to\nremove very small and large fragments. DNA end-repair and 3\u2019-adenylation\nwere performed in the same reaction followed by ligation of the barcoded\nadapters using a set of 96 8-bp barcoded adapters from IDT, Illumina TruSeq\nRNA unique dual (UD) Indexes (PN: 20040870). Post ligation products were\ncleaned twice with AMPure XP beads to get rid of leftover adapters/adapter\ndimers.\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing\nThe resulting tumor and normal PCR-free libraries were sequenced together\nin one lane using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument (ICS v1.8.1 and\nbcl2fastq2 version 2.20.0.422). Paired-end, 2x150 bp sequencing, was\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nperformed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit v1.5 - 300 cycles\n(PN: 20028312) with the NovaSeq XP 4-Lane Kit v1.5 (PN: 20043131).\n\nValidation Methods\nThe Illumina sequencing paired-end FASTQs were assessed with FastQC.\nThe Illumina FASTQs were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome using\nBWA-MEM. The GA4GH QC pipeline was run on the resulting BAM files to\nassess the quality metrics of the alignments (Supplementary Table 2). A\nsummary of QC metrics can be found Table 3.\n\n**PCR-free 2x150 bp Illumina Sequencing (Dataset ID: ILMN-PCR-free-2)**\n\nDNA Isolation\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from approximately five million non-viable\nHG008-T cells (batch 0823p23) and 40 mg of non-viable HG008-N-D tissue\nusing the Revvity chemagic Prime 8 Instrument. Cells were resuspended and\nhomogenized in the tissue lysis buffer, vortexed, and treated with RNase. The\nhomogenate was then transferred to the chemagic Prime 8 instrument where\nDNA was extracted using the chemagic Prime DNA Blood 2k Kit H24 kit (PN:\nCMG-1497). For the normal tissue sample, the tissue was minced with a razor\nblade, incubated overnight in the lysis buffer with proteinase K. The following\nday the homogenate was subjected to an RNase treatment and transferred to\nthe chemagic Prime 8 instrument where DNA was extracted using the\nchemagic Prime DNA blood extraction kit (CMG-1497). Genomic DNA mass\nyields for tumor and normal samples were approximately 68 and 72 ug,\nrespectively. Resulting DNA size was quantified using the PicoGreen Assay\n(Quant-iT\u2122PicoGreen\u2122, catalog# P11496) and the quality was assessed\nusing 1 % agarose gel (Invitrogen\u2122E-Gel\u2122Agarose Gels, catalog#\nG720801).\n\nLibrary Preparation\nLibrary preparation was performed for each sample using an in-house\nPCR-free protocol, with the Roche Kapa HyperPrep PCR-free Kit (PN:\nKK8505). Two libraries were prepared for the tumor sample from 1 ug of\ngDNA for each library and one library was prepared for the normal duodenal\nsample from 1 ug of gDNA. For both tumor and normal samples, DNA was\nsheared into fragments of approximately 450 to 600 bp using a Covaris E220\nsystem. Fragmentation was followed by purification of the fragmented DNA\nusing double-sided bead clean up with different ratios of AMPure XP beads\nto remove very small and large fragments. DNA end-repair and 3\u2019-adenylation\nwere performed in the same reaction followed by ligation of the barcoded\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nadapters using a set of 96 8-bp barcoded adapters from IDT, Illumina TruSeq\nRNA unique dual (UD) Indexes (PN: 20040870). Post ligation products were\ncleaned twice with AMPure XP beads to get rid of leftover adapters/adapter\ndimers.\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing\nThe resulting tumor and normal PCR-free libraries were sequenced on an\nIllumina NovaSeq 6000 (ICS v1.8.1 and bcl2fastq2 version 2.20.0.422). The\ntumor libraries were pooled with other samples and loaded in a single lane\nacross four flowcells. The normal library was sequenced in a pool of samples\nand loaded in one lane. Paired-end, 2x150 bp sequencing, was performed\nusing the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit v1.5 - 300 cycles (PN:\n20028312) with the NovaSeq XP 4-Lane Kit v1.5 (PN: 20043131).\n\nValidation Methods\nThe Illumina sequencing paired-end FASTQs were assessed with FastQC.\nThe Illumina paired-end FASTQ data were aligned to the GRCh38 reference\ngenome using BWA-MEM. The GA4GH QC pipeline was run on the resulting\nBAM files to assess the quality metrics of the alignments (Supplementary\nTable 2). A summary of QC metrics can be found Table 3.\n\n**PCR-free 2x150 bp Illumina Sequencing (Dataset ID: ILMN-PCR-free-3)**\n\nDNA Isolation\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from approximately two million non-viable\nHG008-T cells (batch 0823p23) using Qiagen's QIAamp Blood Mini Kit (PN:\n51104), yielding approximately 6.4 ug of gDNA as measured by a Qubit\nFluorometer and sizing with peak at approximately 21 kb as measured by an\nAgilent Fragment Analyzer. HG008-N-D gDNA was previously isolated from\nnon-viable tissue and quality assessed upon receipt, approximately 2.5 ug as\nmeasured by a Qubit Fluorometer and sizing with peak at approximately 53\nkb as measured by an Agilent Tapestation.\n\nLibrary Preparation\nPCR-free library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq DNA\nPCR-Free High Throughput Library Prep Kit (96 samples) (PN: 20015963),\nstarting with one microgram of gDNA sample. Genomic DNA samples were\nconcentration normalized on a Hamilton robot. Intact gDNA was sheared\nusing the Covaris LE220 sonicator. Fragmentation was followed by an initial\ncleanup and end-repair, which was then followed by a double-sided\nbead-based size selection of the repaired DNA fragments. Size selection was\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowed by A-tailing, in turn followed by ligation using unique dual indexed\n(UDI) adapters (HG008-T: TTCCTGTT-AAGATACT, HG008-N-D:\nCGGACAAC-AATCCGGA) to prevent index hopping on patterned flow cells.\nTwo final bead-based clean-ups of the libraries were subsequently\nperformed. The uniquely indexed libraries were then validated using the\nFragment Analyzer (Agilent) and pooled based on concentration as\ndetermined by Picogreen (ThermoFisher). The final libraries were evaluated\nfor size distribution on the Fragment Analyzer and are quantified by qPCR\nwith adapter specific primers (Kapa Biosystems).\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing\nThe tumor and normal TruSeq libraries were prepared and sequenced\napproximately four months apart. A single library was prepared for each\nsample. For each tumor and normal, the TruSeq library was multiplexed and\nloaded across four lanes of three flow cells to achieve the desired coverage.\nPaired-end, 2x150 bp sequencing, was performed using the Illumina S4\nReagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles) (PN: 20028312) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000\n(ICS v1.7.5, RTA v3.4.4).\n\nValidation Methods\nThe Illumina sequencing paired-end FASTQs were aligned to the GRCh38\nreference genome using BWA-MEM as part of the NYGC somatic cancer\npipeline\n[(https://bitbucket.nygenome.org/projects/WDL/repos/somatic_dna_wdl/brow](https://bitbucket.nygenome.org/projects/WDL/repos/somatic_dna_wdl/browse/README_pipeline.md?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fgiab#deliverables)\n[se/README_pipeline.md?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fgiab#deliverables](https://bitbucket.nygenome.org/projects/WDL/repos/somatic_dna_wdl/browse/README_pipeline.md?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fgiab#deliverables)\n). Prior to alignment, pre-processing of the data was performed using\nadapter trimming and alignment included short-alignment marking, Novosort\nduplicate marking, GATK Base quality score calibration (BSQR). The GA4GH\nQC pipeline was run on the resulting BAM files to assess the quality metrics\nof the alignments (Supplementary Table 2). A summary of QC metrics can be\nfound in Table 3.\n\n### Element Aviti\n\n**Short and long insert PCR-free 2x150 bp Aviti Sequencing (Dataset IDs:**\n**Element-short-2, Element-long-2)**\n\nStandard (short) Insert Library Preparation\nLibrary preparation was performed using previously isolated genomic DNA\n(gDNA), as described above in \u201cTumor and normal samples for\n\nmeasurement\u201d, from non-viable HG008-T cells (batch 0823p23) and\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\nnon-viable HG008-N-D and HG008-N-P tissue. One short insert library (350\nto 400 bp) was prepared from each gDNA source. For each library, 500 ng of\ngDNA was input into the Element Elevate Mechanical Library Prep Kit (PN:\n830-00008, Document # MA-00004 Rev. E) using the Elevate Long UDI\nAdapter Kit Set A (PN: 830-00010). Mechanical shearing of gDNA was\nperformed using a Covaris ultrasonicator to achieve the desired insert size of\napproximately 400 bp. For the short insert libraries seven iterations with the\nfollowing settings were performed: 10 second duration, peak power 50, duty\ncycle 20, 1000 cycles per burst, average power 10. Shearing was followed by\nend repair and A-tailing. PCR-free library preparation continued with adapter\nligation, generating dual-index libraries. Size selection was performed with\ndouble-sided SPRI bead clean-up with SPRI ratios of 0.46X/0.62X. Linear\nshort insert libraries were quantified for loading onto the AVITI system using\nqPCR.\n\nLong Insert Library Preparation\nLibrary preparation was performed using previously isolated genomic DNA\n(gDNA) from non-viable HG008-T cells (batch 0823p23), as described above\n\nin \u201cTumor and normal samples for measurement\u201d, and non-viable\n\nHG008-N-D and HG008-N-P tissue. One long insert library (greater than 1\nkb) was prepared from each gDNA source.

Mechanical shearing of gDNA was\nperformed using a Covaris ultrasonicator to achieve a longer insert size of\napproximately 800 to 900 bp. For the long insert libraries one iteration with\nthe following settings were performed: 5 second duration, peak power 50,\nduty cycle 20, 1000 cycles per burst, average power 10. PCR-free library\npreparation continued with end-repair, A-tailing and adapter ligation,\ngenerating dual-index libraries. Size selection was performed with\ndouble-sided SPRI bead clean-up with SPRI ratios of 0.3X/0.42X. Linear\nlibraries were quantified for loading onto the AVITI system using qPCR using\nthe 2x Phanta Flash master mix (Vazyme PN: P510) and Evagreen (Biotium\nPN:31000).\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing\nLinear libraries were loaded onto individual high output flowcells, 6 flowcells\nin total (3 for short insert, 3 for long insert). The Element AVITI 2x150\nSequencing Kit Cloudbreak UltraQ sequencing chemistry (PN: 860-00018)\nwas used to generate 150 bp paired-end reads on the AVITI system.\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\nValidation Methods\nThe Element AVITI UltraQ paired-end FASTQs were assessed using FastQC.\nThe FASTQs were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome using\nBWA-MEM.

PCR-free library preparation was performed\nusing the PacBio Onso fragmentation DNA library prep kit (PN: 102-499-100).\nTwo libraries were prepared, one for each of the tumor (HG008-T) and normal\nduodenal (HG008-N-D) samples starting with 200 ng of high molecular weight\n(HMW) gDNA. HG008-T and HG008-N-D HMW genomic DNA (gDNA) were\n\nfirst enzymatically fragmented followed by end-repair, A-tailing and adapter\nligation per the fragmentation kit protocol. A small aliquot of libraries were\namplified using the PacBio Onso library amp kit (PN: 102-410-800) for library\nQC purposes (library size measurement by Agilent TapeStation).

Proximity\nligation preparation was performed with the Phase Genomics Proximo Hi-C\nv4.5 kit (PN: KT4045) and associated Proximo human protocol (v4.5 0202301,\n[https://4408603.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4408603/Protocols_la](https://4408603.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4408603/Protocols_latest/Proximo_Human_v4.5_202301.pdf)\n[test/Proximo_Human_v4.5_202301.pdf) to generate a dual-indexed](https://4408603.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4408603/Protocols_latest/Proximo_Human_v4.5_202301.pdf)\nIllumina-compatible library. In brief, intact cells are crosslinked, lysed, and\n\nchromatin digested with a cocktail of restriction endonucleases. Ends are\nfilled in with biotinylated nucleotides and subjected to proximity ligation.\nFollowing ligation, crosslinks are enzymatically reversed and DNA purified.\nProximity ligated junctions are purified using streptavidin beads. Bead-bound\nDNA is used as input for generation of a paired-end Illumina compatible\nlibrary.\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing\nThe Proximo Hi-C library was run on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (ICS v1.7.5,\nRTA v3.4.4) with 2x150 paired-end reads using the NovaSeq 6000 S4\nReagent Kit v1.5 300 cycles (PN: 20028312).

The crosslinked chromatin is then digested using a\nrestriction enzyme (RE) cocktail optimized for coverage uniformity across a\nwide range of genomic sequence compositions. The 5\u2019-overhangs are then\nfilled in, causing the digested ends to be labeled with a biotinylated\nnucleotide. Next, spatially proximal digested ends of DNA are ligated,\ncapturing the sequence and structure of the genome. The ligated DNA is then\npurified, producing pure proximally-ligated DNA. The proximally-ligated DNA\nis then fragmented, and the biotinylated fragments are enriched. HiC ligation\nresulted in 871 ng HiC ligation product for HG008-T and 1760 ng of HiC\nligation product for HG008-N-D.\n\nLibrary Preparation\nThe HG008-T and HG008-N-D HiC ligation products were prepared for\nIllumina Sequencing using the Roche KAPA Hyper Prep kit (PN: 7962347001)\nfollowing the KAPA Hyper Prep kit User Guide (PN: A160139 v00,\n[https://arimagenomics.com/wp-content/files/User-Guide-Library-Preparation-](https://arimagenomics.com/wp-content/files/User-Guide-Library-Preparation-using-KAPA-Hyper-Prep-Kit.pdf)\n[using-KAPA-Hyper-Prep-Kit.pdf ).

Upon receipt of the cell pellet, ultra-high\nmolecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using the Bionano\nSP-G2 Blood & Cell Culture DNA Isolation Kit (PN: 80060) with a yield of\napproximately 6.5 ug of gDNA (100 ng/\u00b5L in 65 \u00b5L elution) with an N50\ngreater than 150 kbp.\n\nSample Preparation\nSequence-specific labeling of the gDNA was performed using the Bionano\nDirect Label and Stain-G2 (DLS-G2) Kit (PN: 80046).\n\nOptical Genome Mapping\nLabeled DNA was loaded onto a Bionano Saphyr Chip G3.3 and measured\nwith the Saphyr System (ICS v5.3.23013.1).

The\nAccess software (v1.8) was used to generate high confidence callsets for SVs\nand unique SVs not present in the Bionano internal control database. High\nconfidence CNV calls were generated after recentering based on the\nhypodiploid tumor genome. Regions where unique SV and CNV calls overlap\nwith Bionano custom pan cancer gene list are also reported.\n\nValidation\n[This sample was processed based on manufacturer protocol., QC metrics,](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/zyQyP)\nused for validation, are further discussed in the Technical Validation section\n(Supplementary Table 2).\n\n28\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cytogenetic analysis\n\n**G-Banded Karyotyping (MGH p31 karyotyping-1 and NIST p18**\n**karyotyping-2)**\n\nKaryotyping was performed by KaryoLogic Inc (Durham, NC) for two\npassages of HG008-T as shown in Figure 2. Approximately one million viable\nHG008-T cells were plated in T25 cell culture flasks, two from MGH and one\nfrom NIST, and sent for karyotyping. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on\ntwenty-five G-banded metaphase spreads of the HG008-T cell line from MGH\npassage 31. A second analysis was performed in 2024 using viable HG008-T\ncells from NIST passage 18. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on twenty\nG-banded metaphase spreads for the HG008-T NIST passage 18 cells (2024).\n\n**Kromatid Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH) (Dataset ID: dGH-1)**\n\nSample Preparation\nSample preparation for dGH analysis was performed at NIST from passage\n21 of HG008-T. One million cells were plated in a T25 flask and were cultured\novernight. The cell culture medium was replaced with dGH cell prep kit\n(KromaTiD, Cat# dGH-0001) contained culture medium, and additional dose\nof dGH cell prep kit was added 4 hr after medium replacement. Cells were\narrested in the first mitosis with a 4-hour Colcemid (KromaTiD, Cat# COL-001)\nblock, harvested, fixed in freshly made fixative [3:1 methanol:acetic acid\n(Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)], and shipped to KromaTiD.\nMetaphase spread preparation along with subsequent UV and exonucleolytic\ntreatments to selectively remove the analog-incorporated daughter strand\n[were performed at KromaTiD according to published dGH protocols.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/MtTC8)\n\nDirectional Genomic Hybridization\nFor whole genome analysis, KromaTiD\u2019s dGH SCREEN assay was hybridized\nto the prepared metaphase spreads, then counterstained with DAPI\n(Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA, USA) and imaged on an\nApplied Spectral Imaging Harmony system (Applied Spectral Imaging,\nCarlsbad, CA, performed USA) using a 100X objective. The dGH SCREEN\nassay consists of single-stranded, unidirectional, tiled oligos designed to\nhybridize directly to the unique sequences in each of the 24 human\nchromosomes. Each chromosome specific complement of oligos is\nend-labeled with one of five unique spectrally differentiable fluorophores, and\neach of these \u201chigh-density chromosome paints\u201d are combined such that\nchromosomes painted in the same color can be differentiated by size, shape,\nand centromere position. Prior to analysis, images of dGH SCREEN painted\n\n29\n\n\n-----\n\nmetaphase spreads are qualified, processed and sorted into karyograms for\nrapid, consistent reading of the assay.\n\nA combination of expected dGH SCREEN signal patterns in the (diploid)\n[human reference genome,](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/sQIWx) the HG008-T standard G-banding karyotypes,\nand the copy number variant was used to construct preliminary dGH\nSCREEN karyograms in 10 cells, including two (2) genome-doubled cells. The\nprototype karyograms will be used to generate per-chromosome attribution of\ninter- and intra-chromosomal structural variation events including inversions,\ntranslocations, aneuploidy (gain and loss), insertions, centromere\nabnormalities and complex events across the sample in additional cells from\npassage 21 (Figure 2).\n\n### Somatic variant annotation\n\nAn initial annotation of a publicly available HG008-T somatic variants called\nby DRAGEN v.4.2.4\n[(https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/data_somatic/HG008/Li](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/data_somatic/HG008/Liss_lab/superseded-2022-data/analysis/DRAGEN-v4.2.4_ILMN-WGS_20230914/dragen_4.2.4_HG008_tumor.hard-filtered.vcf.gz)\n[ss_lab/superseded-2022-data/analysis/DRAGEN-v4.2.4_ILMN-WGS_202309](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/data_somatic/HG008/Liss_lab/superseded-2022-data/analysis/DRAGEN-v4.2.4_ILMN-WGS_20230914/dragen_4.2.4_HG008_tumor.hard-filtered.vcf.gz)\n[14/dragen_4.2.4_HG008_tumor.hard-filtered.vcf.gz) was performed using](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/data_somatic/HG008/Liss_lab/superseded-2022-data/analysis/DRAGEN-v4.2.4_ILMN-WGS_20230914/dragen_4.2.4_HG008_tumor.hard-filtered.vcf.gz)\n[ANNOVAR (v2020-06-08, https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/).](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/)\nDRAGEN calls were made from the Illumina-PCR-free-1 dataset.

Ancestry was\nassessed by germline genetic similarity of these \"target samples\" to reference\nsamples of known genographic origin from the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase\n[3).](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/rkwcP) For computational efficiency, we limited our analysis to chromosome 21.\n[We used PLINK](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/M7FW) to restrict our analysis to SNPs with minor allele frequency\ngreater than or equal to 5 % in the reference panel. We then extracted these\noverlapping loci from the target sample Variant Call File (VCF) and then\n[merged the datasets into a single VCF with bcftools.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/Gi5E) During the merging\nstep, we assumed that entries absent from the target sample VCF at these\nsites were homozygous for the reference allele. We then performed principal\n\n30\n\n\n-----\n\ncomponent analysis (PCA) using PLINK and visualized genetic similarity on\nthe first three principal component axes.\n\n### Haplotype-specific copy number analysis\n\n**NIH-NCI**\nHaplotype-specific copy number analysis was performed using Wakhan\n(https://github.com/KolmogorovLab/Wakhan; manuscript in preparation).\nWakhan computes haplotype-specific coverage of the genome using phased\nheterozygous germline variants. Then it identifies boundaries of the copy\nnumber alteration (CNA) events by analysing SV breakpoints. Prior to running\nWakhan, we phased the germline variants with PacBio long-read (Dataset ID:\n[PB-HiFi-1) and Hi-C (Dataset ID: HiC-ILMN-2) data using HiPhase](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/SBk3k) and\n[HapCUT2.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/rSxal)\n\n# Data Records\n\nThe data presented were collected as part of Genome in A Bottle Consortium\nefforts.

The karyotyping results indicate a\nsubpopulation of the cell line has undergone whole genome doubling (Figure\n2). Whole genome doubling generally is difficult to detect with bulk WGS, but\n[is a common result of TP53 loss, as discussed below.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/0hwbG)\n\n32\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2 Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH) and G-banded karyograms**\nfor three passages of the HG008-T tumor cell line. Karyograms show\nexamples of cells with and without whole genome doubling.

The cell line appears to have\nmany large deletions that cause loss of heterozygosity, with fewer\nduplications. However, whole genome doubling in some cells results in four\ncopies of regions without deletions and two copies of regions with deletions.\n\n**Figure 3 Haplotype Specific Coverage Plot.

The cell line contains the KRAS [c.35G>T;p.G12V]\n(COSMIC ID: COSV55497419, and Pathogenic in ClinVar\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/12583/) gain of function\n[mutation common in PDAC, as well as a likely duplication of the copy of the](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/8hO5H)\ngene containing this mutation. In addition, there is a 20 kbp deletion of part of\nthe p16/CDKNA2 gene, and the other haplotype was lost due to a very large\ndeletion. Other small somatic mutations that may have a functional impact on\ngenes associated with cancer include the mutation K132T\n\n[c.356C>G;p.Ala119Gly] in the remaining copy of the tumor suppressor gene\n_TP53 (COSV52759171, and Likely Pathogenic in ClinVar_\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV001220864/),](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/O0GH1) and a frameshift\nmutation in the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 associated with resistance to\n[therapy.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/7QzoI) Therefore, HG008-T has somatic mutations in the four most\n\n34\n\n\n-----\n\n[commonly mutated genes in TCGA\u2019s analysis of 150 PDAC tumors.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/Avvst)\n\nAdditional stopgain somatic mutations in HG008-T and COSMIC include a\nSNV mutation in GLP2R [c.1030C>T, p.R344*] (COSV52327429), and a SNV\nmutation in INSYN1 [c.457C>T, p.R153*] (COSV65838057). Note that these\nare examples of potentially important somatic mutations in HG008-T, all of\nwhich appear to be in all tumor cells and not in normal cells, but are not a\ncomprehensive list. Also, it is possible that some of these may not have been\nin all cells in the primary tumor and may be new mutations that occurred\nduring cell line development. In addition, we compared the large-scale copy\nnumber alterations observed in HG008-T to recently published signatures of\n[somatic copy alterations in TCGA samples,](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/VI0WO) and the locations and\nprevalence of large deletions are similar to the chromosomal-scale loss of\nheterozygosity (cLOH) signature. The large-scale deletions followed by whole\ngenome doubling in some cells is also consistent with the known progression\n[of TP53-deficient tumors.](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/0hwbG)\n\n## HG008 genetic ancestry analysis\n\nTo assess genetic ancestry of the HG008 individual, we performed principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) using PLINK and visualized genetic similarity on\nthe first three principal component axes (Figure 4). The tumor and normal\nsample pair exhibited high genetic similarity on these axes, supporting their\ncommon germline origin, while also exhibiting the greatest genetic similarity\n[to 1000 Genomes reference samples](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/rkwcP) from the European superpopulation.\n\n**Figure 4 Ancestry Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

We leveraged the GA4GH WGS](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/references/GRCh38/GRCh38_GIABv3_no_alt_analysis_set_maskedGRC_decoys_MAP2K3_KMT2C_KCNJ18.fasta.gz)\nquality control standard reference implementation\n[(https://www.ga4gh.org/product/wgs-quality-control-standards/) for bulk](https://www.ga4gh.org/product/wgs-quality-control-standards/)\nWGS short-read data (Table 3). When appropriate comparable QC tools were\nused for bulk WGS long-read data (Table 4). More information on specific\ntools and metrics generated for validation of short-read and long-read data\ncan be found in the Supplementary Table 2 (Validation Tools) and\nSupplementary Table 3 (Metrics Descriptions). Overall, the QC metrics and\ndata characteristics were consistent with expectations and the data were of\nsufficient quality for downstream analysis and use in material\ncharacterization. Additionally, the datasets have already been used for\nmultiple downstream analyses, e.g. variant calling and genome assembly,\nfurther validating the data quality.\n\nBecause the tumor cell line is aneuploid, we also estimate the mean coverage\nof apparently diploid and haploid regions, as well as number of reads per\n[tumor chromosomal copy (NRPCC).](https://paperpile.com/c/N46zZd/VI0WO) For these estimations, we use the\nmean coverage of chromosome 4 as the haploid coverage because it\nappears to be haploid in most or all cells, as was observed in the single cell\ndata (Dataset ID: sc-ILMN-1). We calculate the diploid coverage as two times\nthe haploid coverage and NRPCC as half the haploid coverage. The diploid\nand haploid coverages are estimated for cells without whole genome\ndoubling, whereas NRPCC is the coverage of each copy of the chromosome\nfor cells with whole genome doubling.\n\nA summary of metrics generated by GA4GH Quality control pipeline for\nshort-read sequencing technologies Ultima, Onso, Illumina, and Element are\npresented in Table 3. The short-read metrics (Table 3) show the insert sizes\nmean and standard deviations were consistent with expected values for the\nlibrary preparation methods used.\n\n36\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3 Short-read Metrics. Summary of metrics generated by the GA4GH**\nQuality Control pipeline, Samtools and Mosdepth for validation of short-read\nPCR-free data. All mapping-based metrics presented are based on\nalignments to the GRCh38 reference genome. Although an Element-short-1\ndataset was generated, it is not presented, rather data from newer chemistry\nin the second dataset is provided, Element-short-2.\n*The Onso percent properly paired and percent mapped reads metrics\npresented represents pairing metric following filtering of 1 bp reads described\nwith the Onso methods. Onso data presented as part of the HG008 dataset is\nnot filtered.\n\nFor long-reads, Table 4 has similar metrics for coverage but has some\ndifferent metrics due to differences in QC tools used for long versus\nshort-reads. For long-read technologies including ONT-std, ONT-UL, and\nPacbio-Revio, QC tools such as Cramino and NanoPlot provide long-read\nspecific metrics for validation (Supplementary Table 2 (Validation Tools) and\nSupplementary Table 3 (Metrics Descriptions)). PycoQC metrics for the ONT\ndatasets were generally consistent with expectations, with one exception.\nThe first flowcell run for the ONT-std-1 dataset showed slightly lower read\nquality, Q18 compared to Q21 for subsequent flowcells measuring the\npancreas library, as reported by pycoQC. This is likely a result of flowcell\nvariability and the flowcell being overloaded for the initial run, approximately\n1.5X higher. For the two subsequent flowcells using the pancreas library, the\nDNA mass input was adjusted down.\n\n37\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 4 Long-read Metrics. Summary of metrics generated from Cramino**\nand Mosdepth for validation of PacBio HiFi and ONT data. All mapping-based\nmetrics presented are based on alignments to the GRCh38 reference\ngenome.\n\nFigure 5a shows the read length distributions weighted by read length, similar\nto the N50 metric, and shows that ONT reads (particularly ultra long ONT,\nONT-UL) are substantially longer than HiFi for the tumor cell line. However,\nbecause extracting very long DNA from normal tissues is more challenging\nthan cell lines, most ONT reads from normal pancreatic and duodenal tissue\nare shorter than from the tumor cell line. Figure 5c depicts this information in\na different manner to make it easier to see the coverage by reads longer than\na certain length (e.g., there is 33x coverage by ONT-UL reads longer than 100\nkb). Figure 5b shows the coverage has a single peak for normal cells but has\ntwo peaks for tumor cells due to apparently haploid and diploid regions.\n\n38\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5 Long-read Coverage Plots.

The methods used for each validation are\ndescribed in the associated Methods section above and in Supplementary\nTable 2.\n\n### Optical mapping validation\n\n Bionano\n\nAll quality metrics for the Bionano-1 dataset passed manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommendations. The HG008-T sample had N50 of 322.82 kbp, labelling\ndensity (label/100 kbp) of 16.26, map rate of 92.2 % and effective coverage\nof 434.72X.\n\n### BioSkryb single cell library validation\n\n Illumina library validation\n\nSingle-cell libraries, from dataset sc-ILMN-1, were validated using the metrics\nreported by BioSkryb analytics BaseJumper platform using the BJ-DNA-QC\npipeline\n[(https://docs.basejumper.bioskryb.com/pipelines/secondary/bj-dna-qc/1.8.2/](https://docs.basejumper.bioskryb.com/pipelines/secondary/bj-dna-qc/1.8.2/docs/#background)\n[docs/#background). The BioSkryb BJ-DNA-QC pipeline metrics include](https://docs.basejumper.bioskryb.com/pipelines/secondary/bj-dna-qc/1.8.2/docs/#background)\ngenome coverage, percentage of mitochondrial contaminating reads,\npercentage of chimeric reads and assessing diversity of reads. A description\nof the BaseJumper reported metrics and their criteria for acceptance can be\nfound in Supplementary Table 3. Pre-seq counts are the estimation of the\ngenomic coverage of a given library if it were to be run at the WGS level. In\nbiological samples, pre-seq counts less than 3,000,000,000 can also\nrepresent biological genomic alterations (such as chromosomal losses).\nSamples with less than 3 billion pre-seq that meet other criteria are manually\nreviewed for copy number alteration to determine if biological features may\nbe impacting this value. Because HG008-T contains substantial copy number\n\n39\n\n\n-----\n\nalterations, particularly chromosomal losses, we are publishing data from\ncells that have pre-seq counts less than 3 billion.\n\nBased on the metrics described above, a total of 98/120 libraries met the\nspecifications by BioSkryb Genomics quality control. However, sequencing\ndata for all 120 libraries is provided because the 22 libraries that did not pass\nBioSkryb QC might still be high quality libraries for cells with significant copy\nnumber alterations. Metrics for all 120 single-cell libraries are reported in\nSupplementary File 2, BioSkryb BJ-DNA-QC .\n\n### Ultima library validation\n\nUltima sequencing of the BioSkryb single cell libraries, presented in dataset\nsc-Ultima-1, was validated using the QC metrics reported from the UG100\nsequencing run in Supplementary File 2, BioSkryb Ultima QC. Data is\nconsidered acceptable if the percentage of aligned reads is greater than 99\n%, percentage of bases with a base quality of 20 is greater than 90 %, and\nthe indel rate is less than 0.7 %.

Alternative splicing (AS), where exons\nand introns are spliced in different combinations to create multiple gene isoforms, is a\nfundamental mechanism for increasing the diversity of gene function. We now know\nthat the vast majority of human multi-exon genes undergo at least some alternative\nsplicing .\n\nRecognizing splice sites computationally is a crucial step in accurately assembling\n\ngene transcripts and annotating genomes. Te most direct method for finding splice\nsites is to use spliced alignment programs such as TopHat , SpliceMap , MapSplice , STAR , and HISAT2  to align RNA-seq reads directly onto a reference genome. Tese alignments provide clear evidence of the locations where introns\nhave been spliced out of messenger RNA. However, splice junctions predicted from read\nalignments are not always reliable, and they may contain false positives due to alignment\nerrors, as well as transcriptional and splicing noise . Computational tools based on\nmachine learning methods such as GeneSplicer , MaxEntScan , SplicePort ,\nSpliceMachine , and others  can help identify some of these false positives.

We describe Splam, a novel method for predicting splice\njunctions in DNA using deep residual convolutional neural networks. Unlike previous\nmodels, Splam looks at a 400-base-pair window flanking each splice site, reflecting\nthe biological splicing process that relies primarily on signals within this window.\nSplam also trains on donor and acceptor pairs together, mirroring how the splicing\nmachinery recognizes both ends of each intron. Compared to SpliceAI, Splam is consistently more accurate, achieving 96% accuracy in predicting human splice junctions.\n\n**Keywords: Splice site predictor, Deep learning, Spliced alignment, Convolutional**\nneural network, Residual block, Dilated convolution\n\n\n-----\n\ntools are trained on known splice sites from a target species and are able to recognize\nsplice sites based on the properties of the genome sequence alone. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been highly successful in a variety of\nareas  have been explored as a possible approach to splice site recognition. Several new splice site predictors, including SpliceAI , SpliceFinder , Spliceator ,\nSpliceRover , and DeepSplice  have adopted CNN-based architectures. Attention-based deep learning models such as DNABERT  and Nucleotide Transformer\n\n have also been recently introduced into the field of splice site prediction, prompted\nby the success of Google\u2019s Transformer architecture . Among these newer methods,\nSpliceAI is considered to represent the state of the art because it has the highest accuracy .\n\nIn this paper, we introduce Splam, a new deep learning approach to splice site pre\ndiction in which the system learns to recognize paired donor and acceptor sites from\ngenomic sequences. In comparison to SpliceAI, our method uses a much shorter flanking context sequence to predict splice sites, which is more biologically realistic. Unlike\nSpliceAI, which was designed to predict a single canonical set of splice sites for each\ngene, Splam is able to predict the splice sites from multiple distinct isoforms for a single gene locus. In our experiments, we demonstrate that Splam is more accurate than\nSpliceAI, and we also show how it can be used to improve the accuracy of genomeguided transcript assemblers by removing spurious alignments produced by spliced\naligners.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Splam: an accurate splice junction recognition model**\n\nWe implemented Splam using a framework based on deep convolutional neural networks to predict splice junctions. Te design is illustrated in Fig.#1a and is discussed in\nmore detail in \u201cMethods\u201d. As illustrated in Fig.#1b and c, the input to Splam is a DNA\nsequence composed of 200 nucleotides (nt) on both sides of the donor and acceptor\nsites, totaling 800 nt, and the output is the probability for every base pair of being a\ndonor site, an acceptor site, or neither (see \u201cMethods\u201d).\n\nTe Splam algorithm focuses on training the model to recognize splice junction pat\nterns at the \u201csplice junction\u201d level; i.e., it attempts to recognize donor and acceptor sites\nin pairs, just as the spliceosome operates in the cell when it splices out an intron. Note\nthat most human genes have multiple splice isoforms, with current annotation catalogs\ncontaining 5\u201310 isoforms per gene. Tus, an accurate model of splicing should be able\nto predict all of the introns in these multiple variants. Splam demonstrates this ability, as\nour experiments will show.\n\nIn contrast, the current state-of-the-art tool, SpliceAI, was trained on a single iso\nform per gene, and moreover was trained on protein-coding genes only. It was originally\ntested by measuring its ability to predict a single set of splice sites from the canonical\nisoform for each protein-coding gene. Designing a splice site recognition method based\nonly on one transcript per gene may result in mislabeling alternative splice sites even\nwhen they are perfectly valid. Our experiments sought to test the hypothesis that our\ntraining regimen, which uses the splice sites from multiple isoforms for each gene, might\nresult in better predictions. Although our discussion below focuses on comparisons\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 1** **a The Splam model architecture consists of 20 residual units (RU), where b each RU comprises two**\nconvolutional layers. The convolutional layers utilize a parameter group of 4, along with batch normalization\nand leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) activations. Blue arrows indicate forward connections, while red arrows\nrepresent residual connections. Within each RU, the input is connected to the output through a residual\nconnection. Overall, the Splam model contains a total of 651,715 parameters. c Splam\u2019s inputs and outputs.\nThe input sequence (in blue) uses 400 nt flanking the donor site and another 400 nt flanking the acceptor\nsite. The output (in yellow) is an array of labels for all 800 nt. d The one-hot encoding procedure for the inputs\nand outputs of Splam employed during model training and testing with A represented as , C as\n\n, G as , T as , and N as . Each pair of donor and acceptor sites is concatenated\n\ninto an 800-nt sequence as shown, and the 200[th] and 600[th] nucleotides are labeled as  (for a donor\nsite) and  (for an acceptor site) respectively (using a 0-based numbering system)\n\nagainst SpliceAI, we also benchmarked Splam against other neural-network-based splice\nsite predictors, described in Additional file#1: Note S1 and Additional file#1: Fig S1 . SpliceAI and Splam both outperformed these competing methods.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of Splam versus SpliceAI in recognizing splice junctions, we\n\ncreated two distinct inputs to SpliceAI for our experiments. Te first, simply called\nSpliceAI, provided 10,400 nt of sequence for each splicing event, following the original SpliceAI study\u2019s approach, which included 200 nt upstream and downstream of\nthe donor and acceptor sites plus 5000 nt of flanking sequence on both sides of each\nsequence being scored. For the second set of inputs, called SpliceAI-10#k-Ns, only 400\nnt of flanking sequence was provided (along with the entire sequence of the intron).\n\n\n-----\n\nTe precise inputs are shown in Additional file#1: Fig S2a and discussed in \u201cMethods\u201d.\nAdditional file#1: Fig S2b shows the relative amount of sequence data used for prediction\nby Splam, SpliceAI, and SpliceAI-10#k-Ns. As the figure illustrates, SpliceAI uses much\nmore context to predict splice sites, even when we replace its normal 10-kilobase (kb)\nflanking input with Ns, because it uses the entire length of the intron. For our experiments, SpliceAI had 14\u201320 times as many base pairs available to make predictions, but\ndespite this advantage, Splam had superior accuracy, as we demonstrate below.\n\nIn all experiments described here, programs were trained on genes from all chromo\nsomes except Chr1 and Chr9, and then tested on genes from chromosomes 1 and 9, after\nfirst removing homologous sequences (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Tis mirrors the training strategy for SpliceAI, which also trained on genes from all chromosomes except Chr1 and\nChr9 and then tested on chromosomes 1 and 9.\n\nWe computed the accuracy of distinguishing positive splice junctions in randomly\n\nselected subsets of two datasets, designated Positive-MANE and Positive-Alt, from a\nrandom subset of negative examples of splice junctions in the Negative-1 and NegativeRandom datasets. Positive-MANE comprises splice junctions selected from the MANE\nannotation  that are supported by a minimum of 100 alignments in a large collection of RNA-seq samples from GTEx. Positive-Alt consists of splice junctions present\nin protein-coding genes from the RefSeq  annotation but not in MANE, and also\nsupported by at least 100 alignments. Tus, all positive examples derive from proteincoding genes, and for many genes, the data includes more than one isoform. Negative-1\ncontains splice junctions on the opposite strand of annotated gene loci, supported by\nexactly 1 alignment, while Negative-Random comprises random GT-AG pairs on the\nopposite strand of annotated genes (see \u201cMethods\u201d for more details).\n\nTe range of precision-recall values at different thresholds obtained by Splam and\n\nSpliceAI are shown in Fig.#2. Figure#2a displays receiver operating characteristic curves\n(ROC) and precision-recall curves (PRC) for both Splam and SpliceAI at the junction\nlevel. It demonstrates that Splam and SpliceAI perform nearly identically on splice sites\nfrom the MANE database but show a noticeable difference in predicting alternative\nsplice sites, with Splam performing better. Furthermore, when SpliceAI is not provided\nthe 10-kb flanking sequence, its performance drops noticeably. Tus, in this data, Splam\npredicts splice junctions in non-canonical transcripts (Positive-Alt) with far fewer false\nnegatives than SpliceAI and SpliceAI-10#k-Ns.\n\nAlthough the ROC and PR curves for SpliceAI appear excellent, we observed that\n\nthe raw scores for true donor and acceptor sites were often very low, even if they were\nslightly higher than the scores for false sites. Ideally, real splice sites will score close\nto 1, while false ones will be closer to 0. Figure# 2b shows that the optimal threshold for SpliceAI is very small (0.0054) and performance quickly drops as the threshold increases. In contrast, the performance of Splam remains stable under a much\nwider range of thresholds. For instance, when using a reasonably high score threshold of 0.8, Splam achieved an overall accuracy of 96.1% on a test set of 40,000 randomly selected examples, with equal numbers of true and false splice junctions, called\nTest40K (see \u201cMethods\u201d); here, accuracy reflects the proportion of correct predictions (positive and negative) out of all predictions. A junction was considered correct\nif both the donor and acceptor sites were predicted correctly.

The test set, Test22K-MANE, consisted of 2000, 10,000,\nand 10,000 examples from Positive-MANE, Negative-1, and Negative-Random respectively, yielding a\npositive-to-negative ratio of one to ten (see \u201cMethods\u201d).

Recall, defined as the proportion of true junctions that were correctly predicted, was slightly lower but still high, at 92.5%. Te precision and recall rates for\ndonor and acceptor sites considered separately were very similar, at 99.6 and 93.0%\nfor both types of sites. By comparison, at the same threshold, SpliceAI had an overall\naccuracy of 74.1% for splice junctions, and 82.1%/84.5% for donors and acceptors on\nthe same data (Table#1).\n\nWe also investigated whether the donor and acceptor scores were in accord with\n\none another; i.e., if the two scores on both ends of an intron were similar. Figure#2c,d\ndisplays the score differences between donor and acceptor sites for Splam and\nSpliceAI.

Figure#2d shows a zoomed-in view that illustrates how, in a small fraction\nof cases, SpliceAI has a score near zero for one site while the other site scores near 1,\nwhile the scores for Splam almost never diverge in this manner.\n\nTo better understand the score distribution, we investigated the scores produced by\n\nSplam and SpliceAI on the Test40K dataset (plotted in Additional file#1: Fig S3). Figure#3\nshows the distributions of scores that Splam and SpliceAI assigned to both true and false\ndonor and acceptor sites at a threshold of 0.1. For clarity in the figure, we omitted the\npoints where Splam and SpliceAI agree and are correct, which totaled 16,820 positives\nand 19,809 negatives, so the figure only shows junctions where at least one program was\nwrong. Te largest class of disagreements were the 2609 true splice junctions where\nSplam was correct and SpliceAI was wrong, shown in red. In contrast, there were only\n202 true junctions (light blue) where SpliceAI was correct and Splam was wrong. Figure#3a (1) illustrates how the Splam scores cluster into two groups, near (0, 0) and (1, 1),\ncorresponding to splice sites where both donor and acceptor are either low-scoring or\nhigh-scoring. As shown in Fig.#3a (2), SpliceAI is more likely to assign high scores to one\nsplice site and very low scores to the other; i.e., the junction scores are inconsistent.\n\nAlthough SpliceAI has many more false negatives (missed splice sites), Splam does\n\nhave slightly more false positives, 145 versus just 16 for SpliceAI. In general, for splice\nsite recognition, we consider the false positives less problematic because the splice-sitelike unannotated sequences (i.e., sequences that either program labels as splice sites\nalthough they are not annotated as such) are not necessarily true negatives, since they\nmight be recognized and spliced at low levels . In contrast, failing to identify legitimate positive splice junctions in MANE or RefSeq (false negatives) is much more likely\nto be a genuine error.\n\nWe further focused on positively labeled splice junctions which were correctly cap\ntured by one tool but not the other (Fig.# 3b). Our findings indicate that Splam consistently captures more splice junctions compared to SpliceAI across all thresholds.\nFurthermore, Splam outperforms SpliceAI in distinguishing splice junctions in alternatively spliced isoforms (Fig.# 3c). Not surprisingly, Splam exhibits even larger improvements when compared to SpliceAI-10#k-Ns, as illustrated in Additional file#1: Fig S4,\nAdditional file#1: Fig S5, Additional file#1: Fig S6, and Additional file#1: Fig S7.\n\n**Generalization to other species**\n\nA frequent concern about deep learning methods is whether they simply memorize the\ntraining data, or if their predictive models will work on data that diverges from what they\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 3** **a Scatter plots for Splam (1) and SpliceAI (2) on a test set, Test40K, consisting of 10,000 Positive-MANE,**\n10,000 Positive-Alt, 10,000 Negative-1, and 10,000 Negative-Random examples, with each dot representing\na splice junction. The red dashed lines show the 0.1 cutoff threshold used here to label splice sites as true or\nnot.

To evaluate the generalization ability of Splam\u2019s model of splicing, we collected data from three successively more distant species and applied Splam to\neach of them, without re-training. For comparison, we also applied SpliceAI to the same\ndata.\n\nFor this experiment, we chose genes from three highly curated reference genomes:\n\nchimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), mouse (Mus musculus), and the flowering plant _Arabi-_\n_dopsis thaliana. For each genome, we extracted a random sample of 25,000 introns along_\nwith flanking sequences, as defined by the reference annotation (see \u201cMethods\u201d), and\napplied both Splam and SpliceAI. Te results are shown in Fig.#4.\n\nFor both Splam and SpliceAI, the mammalian datasets (chimpanzee and mouse) show\n\nsimilar score distributions to their scores on human splice sites, indicating that both\nprograms achieved some generalization. However, in both cases Splam\u2019s scores show a\ntighter distribution around 1.0, indicating that it recognizes the non-human splice sites\nsomewhat more strongly. For the plant genome, though, which is far more distant from\nhuman, Splam still assigns very high scores to a large majority of splice sites, as shown\nin the figure, while SpliceAI seems to recognize very few annotated splice sites. Tus\ndespite (or possibly because of) its much smaller input window, Splam\u2019s performance\ngeneralizes quite well, even to species as distant as plants.\n\nIn addition, we evaluated Splam and SpliceAI using datasets of negative examples for\n\nthese species (see \u201cMethods\u201d), and both programs exhibited prominent peaks near 0\n\n**Fig. 4** Comparison of score distributions for Splam (green) and SpliceAI (orange) when applied to 25,000\nrandomly chosen splice sites from chimpanzee (left), mouse (center), and Arabidopsis thaliana (right). Results\nfor donor sites are shown across the top, and acceptor sites on the bottom. Scores assigned by each program\nare plotted along the x-axis, while densities for both donor and acceptor sites are plotted on the y-axis. The\ndarkened vertical line through the distribution marks the median value, and the two neighboring dotted\nlines represent the first and third quartiles. The scores for Splam exhibit a narrow distribution that peaks\nnear 1.0, illustrating that the vast majority of annotated splice sites are assigned high scores, even in the\n_A. thaliana genome. Scores for SpliceAI are more spread out for the chimpanzee and mouse, and the scores_\nfor A. thaliana splice sites show an M-shaped distribution peaking at 0 and 1 with a median near 0.5, rather\nthan just peaking near 1\n\n\n-----\n\n(Additional file#1: Fig S8). Notably, even in the plant genome, Splam consistently demonstrated low false negatives across different thresholds, outperforming SpliceAI (see ROC\nand PR curves in Additional file#1: Fig S9).\n\nAt a score threshold of 0.8, the recall of Splam for splice junctions is 91, 87, and 80%\n\nfor chimpanzee, mouse, and _Arabidopsis thaliana respectively. At the same threshold,_\nSpliceAI had recall rates of 57, 47, and 20% (Table# 2). Te results when using a score\nthreshold of 0.1 are shown in Additional file#1: Table#S1.\n\nWorth noting is that A. thaliana has far shorter introns, with an average length of 168\n\nnt compared to 6200 nt for humans and other mammals. No measurable correlation\nbetween intron length and score was observed for either Splam or SpliceAI (Additional\nfile#1: Fig S10).\n\n**Efect of fltering low-scoring spliced alignments on transcriptome assembly**\n\nOne crucial step in many transcriptome analyses involves aligning spliced reads to the\ngenome, using an alignment program such as HISAT2  or STAR . Te output\nfrom these programs might contain two types of erroneous alignments: (1) incorrect\nalignments due to sequencing errors, repeats, or other sequence artifacts (computational\nnoise), and (2) correct alignments of reads that result from noisy splicing (biological\nnoise). Either computational or biological noise  can lead to systematic underestimates of transcript abundance levels and large increases in the number of false positive\ngenes and transcripts . We reasoned that Splam could distinguish novel splice junctions from both types of noisy junctions, which would receive low scores from Splam. To\nassess Splam\u2019s efficacy on ambiguous, unannotated splice junctions in RNA-seq alignments, we created a series of unannotated splice junction datasets with varying levels of\nsupport, ranging from Novel-2 to Novel-100, as described in the \u201cMethods\u201d section. Our\nobservations showed that while splice junctions are predominantly predicted as negative junctions for those with low spliced alignment support, those supported by a higher\nnumber of spliced alignments receive higher average scores from Splam (see Additional\nfile#1: Note S2 and Additional file#1: Fig S11 and S12). We also evaluated the splice junctions supported by over 10,000 spliced alignments in the GTEx dataset, excluding those\npresent in the MANE annotation, which comprised 149,901 junctions. Splam tended to\ngive these well-supported junctions relatively high scores, with a mean score of 0.66 for\n\n**Table 2 Accuracy, recall, and precision for donor sites, acceptor sites, and splice junctions at the**\nscore threshold of 0.8 for Splam and SpliceAI in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), mouse (Mus musculus),\nand the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana\n\n\n**Tool** **Accuracy (%)**\n**(Donor / Acceptor /**\n**Junction)**\n\n\n**Recall (%)**\n**(Donor / Acceptor /**\n**Junction)**\n\n\n**Precision (%)**\n**(Donor /**\n**Acceptor /**\n**Junction)**\n\n\n_Pan troglodytes_ Splam 95.7 / 95.7 / 95.5 91.4 / 91.4 / 91.0 99.9 / 99.9 / 99.9\n\nSpliceAI 84.6 / 86.0 / 78.7 69.2 / 72.0 / 57.3 99.9 / 99.9 / 99.9\n\n_Mus musculus_ Splam 93.6 / 93.7 / 93.3 87.3 / 87.4 / 86.6 99.9 / 99.9 / 99.9\n\nSpliceAI 80.0 / 82.1 / 73.6 59.7 / 64.2 / 47.3 99.9 / 99.9 / 99.9\n\n_Arabidopsis thaliana_ Splam 90.7 / 90.4 / 90.0 81.4 / 80.9 / 80.2 99.9 / 99.9 / 99.9\n\nSpliceAI 68.2 / 67.8 / 60.0 36.3 / 35.7 / 20.0 99.8 / 99.9 / 99.9\n\n\n-----\n\nboth donor and acceptor sites, and 66.7% of these junctions scored above 0.5 for both\nsites.\n\nWe also evaluated the effectiveness of using Splam to improve the quality of transcrip\ntome assemblies by removing low-scoring splice junctions. Using the workflow illustrated in Fig.# 5 and further detailed in \u201cMethods\u201d, we processed 20 randomly selected\nRNA-seq samples, of which 10 were prepared using a poly-A capture library preparation, and 10 were prepared using ribosomal RNA depletion.\n\nFirst, we compared all the splice junctions in the alignment files before and after fil\ntering with Splam to all introns in the RefSeq GRCh38.p14 version 40 annotation file.\nWhile some of the splice junctions in the alignment files are no doubt real, an accurate\nfiltering procedure should increase the intron precision, while minimizing the decline\nin intron recall as computed with respect to RefSeq (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Indeed, Splam\u2019s\nresults do follow this pattern, as illustrated in Fig.# 5. Figure# 5c and Additional file# 1:\nTable#S2 show the metrics for the 10 poly-A RNA-seq samples. Te precision scores for\neach sample showed a substantial absolute percentage increase, ranging from 14 to 25%,\nwith only a minimal reduction in recall (less than 1%). Figure#5d and Additional file#1:\nTable#S3 illustrate the results for the 10 rRNA depletion samples, where precision exhibited even higher absolute percentage improvements, ranging from 28 to 37%, with only a\nslight decrease in recall, ranging from 0.7 to 1.0%.\n\nSecond, we evaluated the impact of the Splam removal procedure on downstream\n\ntranscriptome assembly. We ran StringTie  on both the original alignment files and\nthe Splam-cleaned alignment files and compared how closely the transcript assemblies\nmatch the RefSeq gene annotation file. A successful removal procedure would improve\nboth the precision and recall of transcriptome assembly. Among the 10 poly-A capture\nsamples, the number of matching transcripts remained almost unchanged, while the\nprecision scores consistently improved by an absolute percentage of 2.1 to 2.7% (Fig.#5e\nand Additional file#1: Table#S4). For the 10 ribosomal RNA depletion samples, both metrics showed even more substantial improvements. Following the Splam removal process,\nwe consistently observed an increase of 500 to 600 matching transcripts being assembled, while precision showed a 5.5 to 6.5% absolute percentage improvement (Fig.#5f and\nAdditional file#1: Table#S5). Other transcriptome assembly metrics, such as the number\nof matching intron-chains, assembled hypothetical exons, and missed exons from the\nannotation, show the same picture: by eliminating low-scoring spliced alignments, we\nachieve more accurate assemblies of transcripts from both poly-A capture and ribosomal RNA depletion RNA-seq samples, with a particularly notable impact in the latter\nsamples (see Tables S6-S11).\n\n**Discussion**\n\nIn this study, we presented Splam, a convolutional neural network that recognizes splice\njunctions in their genomic context. An important principle that we used in designing\nSplam was that the input should be constrained to be biologically realistic. Te previous state-of-the-art CNN-based system, SpliceAI, relies on a window of 10,000 base\npairs flanking each splice site plus the entire intronic sequence, which is far larger than\nwhat the splicing machinery in the cell can possibly recognize. Introns are flanked by a\n5\u2019 donor site and a 3\u2019 acceptor site, usually beginning and ending with the dinucleotides\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 5** **a The workflow of a typical RNA-seq pipeline. b The modified workflow using Splam to remove**\nspurious alignments. c\u2013f Effects of using Splam to remove low-scoring splice junctions from RNA-seq\nexperiments. c\u2013d Results of comparing introns in the RefSeq annotation with splice junctions extracted\nfrom the alignment files of 10 poly-A capture (c) and 10 rRNA depletion (d) RNA-seq samples.

In c,d, the y-axis\nshows the number of assembled transcripts that matched RefSeq transcripts\n\n\n-----\n\nGT and AG. A short window of sequence around each end is recognized by the spliceosome, as well as a branch point about 35\u201340 bases upstream of the acceptor site . In\naddition to these three limited regions, short motifs within the introns and exons known\nas splicing enhancers and repressors might also affect the splicing process. In total, then,\nat most a few hundred nucleotides determine whether or not an intron is recognized and\nspliced out. Notably, all of the crucial sequences involved in splicing and spliceosome\nassembly are localized in close proximity to the donor and acceptor sites. Tus, it should\nonly be necessary to look in these regions to predict splice sites. We were concerned\nthat the performance improvements observed in SpliceAI when increasing the flanking\nsequences from 80 to 10,000 nt, as described in , may have been due to overfitting or\nmemorization of the training set.\n\nWe conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate some key parameters in Splam\u2019s\n\ndesign. In the first set, we trained the model on input sequences ranging from 40 to 800\nnt, as described in Additional file#1: Note S3 and Additional file#1: Fig S13. Tose experiments led us to choose 800 nt as the input for our final model. In the second experiment,\nwe conducted an ablation study to determine the optimal number of residual groups\nwithin the neural network, varying this number from one to five. Tat experiment,\ndescribed in Additional file#1: Note S4 and Additional file#1: Fig S14, led us to choose five\nresidual groups for the model\u2019s configuration.\n\nUnlike previous systems, Splam analyzes donor and acceptor sites jointly, to cap\nture dependencies between splice sites. Tis dual-window approach is not intended\nfor exhaustive scanning across entire chromosomes, which might require considering\na quadratic number of donor\u2013acceptor site candidates. Instead, Splam is designed for\nevaluating putative splice junctions that have supporting evidence either from alignments of RNA-seq data or from existing annotation.\n\nIn the biological context, donor and acceptor sites are not independent. Terefore,\n\nrather than training separately on the two types of splice sites, Splam is designed and\ntrained to recognize pairs of donor and acceptor sites, mimicking the behavior of the\nspliceosome. Although there is a strong correlation between Splam\u2019s donor and acceptor site scores, the model is intentionally designed to produce distinct scores for each.\nTis design can be useful in cases where the scores differ suggesting that one of the sites\nmight be weaker than the other.\n\nWe also showed that the Splam model generalizes quite well, as illustrated by our\n\nevaluations on chimpanzee, mouse, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Unsurprisingly, its performance on chimpanzee was very similar to its performance on human, but perhaps more\nsurprising was its accuracy in predicting splice sites in a plant genome, where it obtained\n81.4% sensitivity on donors and 80.9% sensitivity on acceptors. We would expect that if\nre-trained on species-specific data, Splam would improve even further on those species.\n\nWe also tested Splam\u2019s ability to remove spurious splice junctions from the output of a\n\nspliced aligner. We showed that when used in this manner, Splam can create alignment\nfiles that contain many fewer noisy splicing events while losing only a small number of\ntrue splice sites. When the cleaned files are used as input to a transcriptome assembler\nsuch as StringTie2, we not only observed higher precision but also an increased number of assembled transcripts that matched known transcripts. Tese improvements were\nparticularly notable when the filtering process was applied to RNA-seq data generated\n\n\n-----\n\nusing rRNA depletion, which generally contains many more incompletely processed\ntranscripts.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nSplam is a new deep-learning-based splice site predictor providing a faster and more\naccurate method for predicting splice junctions. Moreover, Splam offers a reliable and\nefficient solution for cleaning up erroneous spliced alignments, which is shown to\nsubstantially improve transcript analysis of both poly(A) and ribo-depleted RNA-seq\nlibraries.\n\n**Methods**\n\n**Generating high-quality datasets for splice junctions**\n\nWe curated two sets of positive examples, \u201cPositive-MANE\u201d and \u201cPositive-Alt\u201d, and two\nsets of negative examples, \u201cNegative-1\u201d and \u201cNegative-Random\u201d, to serve as high-quality datasets for training and testing the Splam model. Additionally, we prepared a series\nof testing datasets, from Novel-2 through Novel-100, to evaluate splice junctions with\nvarying levels of spliced alignment support. DNA logos for these datasets are presented\nin Fig.#6a. Te MANE data was taken from the RefSeq GRCh38 MANE release 1.0 file.\nNote that Refseq and GENCODE agree 100% on all MANE annotations . To create the Positive-Alt dataset, we used RefSeq annotation version 110 , from which\nwe collected all splice junctions missing from MANE. Te resulting annotation file contains information about (1) the location of all annotated splice junctions and (2) the label\ninformation of the indices of the donor and acceptor site for each splice junction. We\nused GRCh38 assembly version 40 as the reference genome sequence.\n\n**Positive dataset creation**\n\nWe first ran TieBrush  to consolidate the HISAT2 alignments of 9795 samples, collected across 31 histological types by the GTEx consortium project, into a single compressed BAM file. Tis TieBrush file was recently used to build the CHESS (v3) gene\ncatalog . Following the consolidation, we extracted all splice junctions from the BAM\nfile using the Regtools junctions extract command .\n\nTo increase the accuracy of the donors and acceptors extracted from the TieBrush\n\nfile, we filtered the junctions to retain only those that were supported by more than 100\nalignments. We used the RefSeq annotation to extract the coordinates of all proteincoding genes and intersected these with the reliable (100 + alignments) splice sites. Te\nresulting splice sites were categorized as \u201cPositive-MANE\u201d if they were in MANE, and\n\u201cPositive-Alt\u201d if they were only in RefSeq but not in MANE. Tis gave us a set of annotated splice junctions from protein-coding genes that also had strong alignment evidence. Overall, we identified 181,123 splice sites in Positive-MANE and 96,484 splice\nsites in Positive-Alt.\n\n**Negative dataset creation**\n\nWe considered several ways to generate negative splice junctions. For instance, we\ncould select random unannotated GT-AG pairs from the genome as negative splice\nsites. GT-AG pairs account for more than 98% of all splice sites in mammalian\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 6** **a Illustration of the four types of splice sites used for training and testing Splam: Positive-MANE,**\nPositive-Alt, Negative-1, and Negative-Random. Positive-MANE sites (blue) are selected from the MANE\ndatabase and supported by at least 100 alignments, while Positive-Alt sites (green) are present in the RefSeq\ndatabase but missing from MANE, and also supported by at least 100 alignments. Negative-1 sites (orange)\noccur on the opposite strand of a known gene and are supported by only 1 alignment, and Negative\nRandom sites (red) are random GT-AG pairs on the opposite strand that do not overlap with any known splice\nsites and have no alignment support. b DNA logos for donor and acceptor site for Positive-MANE, Positive-Alt,\nNegative-Random, Negative-1, Novel-50, and Novel-100 display the conservation of residues at each position\nin the training set created for this study. Each panel displays 40 nucleotides, centering on the donor and\nacceptor sites. The y-axis represents the level of conservation, measured in bits, with 0 representing equal\nprobability among \u201cA\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cG\u201d, and \u201cT\u201d, and 2 representing a single-nucleotide dominating the position\n\ngenomes in GenBank , but the vast majority of random GT-AG pairs are not\nsplice junctions. However, the patterns of these artificial junctions might differ greatly\nfrom true splice sites, making them easy to learn but less useful for rejecting transcriptional noise. Arbitrarily labeling unannotated junctions as negatives would also\nbe inappropriate because some of them may actually be spliced. Tis could happen\nbecause of incomplete annotation, transcriptional noise, or other reasons .\n\nNonetheless, we needed to generate an accurate set of negative examples for train\ning Splam, and we adopted two approaches. Te first approach involved selecting random GT-AG pairs on the genome and requiring them to be on the opposite strand\nfrom known protein-coding genes. Overlapping genes are very rare in eukaryotes\n\n, so these will almost certainly be negative examples. We selected random\n\n\n-----\n\nGT-AG pairs in this fashion to generate 4,467,910 splice junctions, which we call the\nNegative-Random set.\n\nSecond, we wanted a set of negative examples that resembled true splice junctions,\n\nbut that were likely to be non-functional. To generate this set, we chose splice junctions\nwith only a single alignment supporting them in the TieBrush file and further required\nthat they be on the strand opposite from a protein-coding gene. Because they have an\nalignment supporting them, these splice junctions might represent transcriptional noise,\nmaking them more useful for training. Tis approach generated a set of 2,888,042 splice\njunctions, which we refer to as Negative-1.\n\n**RNA-seq novel junction dataset creation**\n\nIn practice, RNA-seq alignments contain many unannotated splice junctions with different levels of evidence suggesting they may bound a possible intron. To evaluate Splam\u2019s\nrecognition of \u201cnegative\u201d splice junctions, we expanded our test dataset by adopting the\nsame criteria used for the Negative-1 but varying the levels of spliced alignment support.\nTis led to datasets named Novel-2 through Novel-100, based on the number of supporting spliced alignments. It is important to note that these datasets were solely used\nfor evaluating Splam and were not seen during the training process. Te underlying logic\nfor this approach is that splice junctions with a greater count of biological read supports\nare more likely to represent unannotated novel splice junctions.\n\n**Evaluating the donor and acceptor sites in positive and negative datasets**\n\nFigure#6b shows DNA logos for each of our positive and negative datasets, showing the\nsequence composition and conservation levels. Te donor and acceptor patterns for\nPositive-MANE and Positive-Alt are almost identical, indicating that splice junctions in\nMANE and alternatively spliced transcripts from RefSeq have the same consensus, as\nexpected for positive examples. Te two negative datasets show almost no pattern of\nconservation, although the Negative-1 group has a very small amount of conservation\nimmediately adjacent to each splice junction. Te two groups of negatively labeled splice\njunctions are clearly distinguishable from the annotated true splice sites. For the Novelx datasets, DNA logos from Novel-50 and Novel-100 categories show slight differences\ncompared to Negative-1, especially in the acceptor sequences, where faint signals of a\npolypyrimidine tract appear upstream of the conserved AG acceptor motif. Tis indicates that while these unannotated junction sets are mostly negative, a small portion of\npositive splice junctions might exist within the Novel-50 and Novel-100 datasets. Additional file#1: Table#S12 reports the numbers of dinucleotides at the donor and acceptor\nsites, and Additional file#1: Fig S15 illustrates the ratio of canonical to non-canonical\nsplice sites.\n\n**Splam input and output data encoding**\n\nFor curating input splice sites, we extract a 400-nt sequence centered around each end\nof an intron, learning the splicing pattern at the junction level. Tis approach facilitates\nlocal prediction of a splicing event, removes any canonical transcript bias, and eliminates the reliance on a larger window size, which for SpliceAI includes the whole intron\nand 10,000 nt of flanking sequences.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor every splice junction coordinate, we used gffread  to extract sequences of 400\n\nnt around donors and acceptor sites, in total 800 nt. In cases where the intron length\nfalls between 200 and 400 base pairs, we select a 200-nt sequence from both the donor\nand acceptor sides, with overlapping sequences allowed. For introns shorter than 200\nnt, we include the entire intron with Ns inserted to extend the sequence to 200 nt for\nboth donor and acceptor sites. Te input sequences are then one-hot encoded, with\n\n[A, C, G, T, N ] represented as , , , , and  .\n\nOne-hot encoding was chosen its simplicity and because it is widely used in similar\napplications, including SpliceAI , Basenji , Spliceator , SpliceFinder , and\nEnformer .\n\nIn terms of the labeling of splice sites, we one-hot encoded the 200[th] nucleotide (the\n\ndonor site) as , and the 600[th] nucleotide (the acceptor site) as  (using a\n0-based numbering system). Nucleotides at non-donor and acceptor sites were labeled\nas  . For the input sequences, over 95% of them had GT as their 200[th] and 201[st]\nnucleotides, and AG as their 598[th] and 599[th] nucleotides. We also note that 8 donor sites\nhad \u201cTT\u201d and another 8 donor sites had \u201cGA\u201d in the MANE database (Additional file#1:\nTable#S12).\n\n**Splam model architecture design**\n\nTe model design of Splam mainly follows the architecture of SpliceAI with some\noptimizations. We utilized a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) that\nincorporates grouped dilated convolution layers within the residual units (Fig.#1a). Te\ninput to the model is 800 nt of one-hot encoded DNA sequence, with the dimension of\n3 \u00d7 800, and the output is a 3 \u00d7 800 array with the predicted probability that each base\nis a donor site, acceptor site, or neither (Methods: \u201cSplam input and output data encoding\u201d). Te Splam program outputs the nucleotide scores at positions 200 and 600 as the\ndonor and acceptor scores, respectively. We constructed the Splam model using PyTorch\nframework version 1.13.0 .\n\nTe Splam model consists of 20 residual units, each containing two convolutional lay\ners, and each convolutional layer follows a batch normalization and a Leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU)  with a negative slope of 0.1 as shown in Fig.# 1a. We define the\ninputs of a residual unit using four hyperparameters: F for the number of filters, W for\nthe window size, D for the dilation rate, and G for the number of groups. Tese input\nhyperparameters are represented as (F, W, D, G) in Fig.#1b. Te input to a convolutional\nlayer is defined as (F, W, D) . Two key ideas used in the Splam model architecture are (1)\nresidual connection and (2) grouped dilated convolution.\n\nResidual units were first proposed by He et#al. in 2015  to solve the training accu\nracy degradation problem . Te residual mappings (shortcut connections) allow\none to train the deeper model by simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation and can result in accuracy gains from the increment in the depth of the\nmodel. Te concept of residual connection is widely used in deep neural networks today\nto prevent the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. In Splam, the input of a residual\nunit is connected to its output through a residual connection.\n\nIn the Splam model, the 1-D convolutional layers in each residual unit have a dila\ntion rate parameter, denoted as D . Te dilation rate determines the spacing between the\n\n\n-----\n\nvalues in the convolutional filter, allowing the network to have a larger receptive field\nwithout increasing the number of parameters without loss of resolution or coverage .\nTe dilated convolution operation is defined as follows:\n\n\ufffd\n\nFout (n) = (F in\u2217DK )(n) = Fin(s) \u00d7 K (t) (1)\n\ns+Dt=n\n\n\nwhere Fin is the input feature, Fout is the out feature, K is the convolutional kernel, n represents the index of the output feature, and \u2217D represents the dilated convolution operation (Equation ( 1 )). In Splam, the dilated convolutional kernel captures features from a\nneighboring region spanning D \u00d7 (W \u2212 1) in#Fin, encompassing a total of 2D \u00d7 (W \u2212 1)\nneighboring positions for the input of the respective residual unit.\n\nTe idea of grouped convolution in Splam was inspired by the cardinality concept,\n\nwhich refers to the number of parallel paths present in a block, as seen in ResNext .\nTe concept of grouped convolution dates back to AlextNet  and is implemented in\nwidely used open-source machine learning frameworks such as Caffe , Keras ,\nTensorFlow , and PyTorch . Te use of grouped convolution allows for substantial memory savings with minimal loss of accuracy, which can further push the model\ndeeper . In a grouped convolution with G groups, F /G filters are applied to each\nF /G portion of the input, resulting in a G\u00d7 reduction in the number of parameters used.\nIn Splam, each residual unit consists of two convolutional layers where F is set to 64 and\nthe group parameter is set to 4.\n\nA group of four residual units (RUs) forms a bigger residual group, and 20 RUs are\n\nclustered into five residual groups, in the order of blue, green, orange, yellow, and purple\nin Fig.#1. Residual groups are stacked such that the output of the i th residual group is\nforward-connected to the i + 1 th residual group (forward connections colored in blue).\n\nFurthermore, the output of each residual group undergoes a convolutional layer, with\n\nthe parameters (64, 1, 1), which is then added to all the other outputs of residual groups\n(residual connections colored in red), which then is passed into the last convolutional\nlayer in (3, 1, 1) and a softmax layer, generating a 3-dimensional input Tensor with three\nchannels lying in the range  and summing to 1. F is set to 64 for all convolutional\nlayers. For each residual group, W is set to 11, 11, 11, 21, and 21, and D is set to 1, 5,\n10, 15, and 20, in sequence. G is 1 by default for all convolutional layers but set to 4 in\nthe residual units. For each nucleotide position, its total neighboring span in the Splam\n20\nmodel is S = i=1 [D][i][ \u00d7][ (][W][i][ \u2212] [)][ . In total, there are 651,715 parameters in Splam.]\n\n**Model training and testing**\n\nSplam was trained on a MacBook Pro 2021 Apple M1 Pro chip with 16 GPU cores, 16\nNeural Engine cores, and 16#GB unified RAM using PyTorch \u201cmps\u201d mode.\n\n**Splitting splice junctions into training and testing datasets**\n\nAfter collecting and curating the splice junctions to be used for training and testing,\nwe divided them into two datasets: one for model training and the other for testing.\nFor model training, we utilized all the splice sites on the main chromosomes, except\nChromosomes 1 and 9. For model testing, we used the splice sites on the held-out\n\n\n-----\n\nChromosomes 1 and 9, after removing splice sites from genes that had paralogs on the\nother chromosomes.\n\nAs discussed in the main text, we curated two sets of positive splice sites: Positive\nMANE and Positive-Alt. Out of the 181,123 splice sites in Positive-MANE, 155,048 were\nallocated to the training dataset and 26,075 to the testing dataset. For Positive-Alt, out\nof the 96,484 splice sites, 83,025 were allocated to the training dataset and 13,459 to the\ntesting dataset. In total, 238,073 positive splice sites were used for model training. We\nalso curated two types of negative splice sites, Negative-Random and Negative-1. Out of\nthe 4,467,910 splice sites in Negative-Random, 3,834,401 were allocated to the training\ndataset and 633,509 to the testing dataset. For Negative-1, out of the 2,888,042 splice\nsites, 2,494,489 were allocated to the training dataset and 393,553 to the testing dataset.\nIn total, we randomly selected twice as many negative splice sites as positive splice sites,\ntotaling 238,073 for both Negative-Random and Negative-1. Tis resulted in a total of\n476,146 negative splice sites being utilized for model training.\n\n**Four test datasets for evaluating Splam**\n\nWe generated four test datasets, namely Test40K, Test22K-MANE, Test22K-Alt, and\nTest24K. Tese datasets were derived from sampling the human splice junctions test\ndataset described in \u201cMethods\u201d.\n\nTest40K encompasses 10,000 splice junctions each from Positive-MANE, Positive-Alt,\n\nNegative-1, and Negative-Random examples, maintaining a positive-to-negative ratio of\none-to-one.\n\nTest22K-MANE, Test22K-Alt, and Test24K share the same 10,000 Negative-1 and\n\n10,000 Negative-Random examples with Test40K. To simulate the sparsity of true\njunctions in the genome, we created a test set with a positive-to-negative ratio of 1:10,\ndownsampling the initial 10,000 Positive-MANE and 10,000 Positive-Alt to 2,000 Positive-MANE and 2,000 Positive-Alt, respectively.\n\nIn sum, Test22K-MANE consists of 2000 Positive-MANE, 10,000 Negative-1, and\n\n10,000 Negative-Random examples; Test22K-Alt consists of 2000 Positive-Alt, 10,000\nNegative-1, and 10,000 Negative-Random examples; and Test24K consists of 2000 Positive-MANE, 2000 Positive-Alt, 10,000 Negative-1, and 10,000 Negative-Random. We\nused these datasets to evaluate Splam\u2019s ability to recognize splice junctions discussed in\n\u201cResults\u201d.\n\n**Splam training hyperparameters**\n\nTo train Splam, we used a batch size of 100 and trained it for 15 epochs. We employed\nthe AdamW  optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.03. A 1000-step warmup was\nutilized , with the learning rate increasing linearly from 0 to 0.03. Te learning rate\nthen decreased following the values of the cosine function between 0.03 and 0 .\n\nWe further improved Splam\u2019s performance by changing the loss function. Instead of\n\nthe commonly used cross entropy (Eq.#(2)), we replaced it with focal loss (Eq.#(3)) .\n\n\ufffd\n\nLossCLE = \u2212 Iclass \u00d7 log(Pclass)\n(2)\n\nclass\u2208{donor,acceptor,neither}\n\n\n-----\n\n\ufffd\n\nLossFL = \u2212 Iclass \u00d7 (1 \u2212 Pclass)\u03b3 \u00d7 log(Pclass)\n(3)\n\nclass\u2208{donor,acceptor,neither}\n\nIclass is the ground-truth label and Pclass is the Splam output score for each class\n\n(donor, acceptor, or neither). Comparing the two equations, we can see that Eq.#(3) has\nan additional modulating term, (1 \u2212 Pclass)\u03b3 . Tis term scales the cross-entropy loss\ndynamically, with the scaling factor decreasing to zero as confidence in the correct class\nincreases. In other words, the focal loss approach puts more emphasis on the misclassified challenging data points where Splam is more likely to make incorrect predictions\nand penalizes these data points by an additional (1 \u2212 Pclass)\u03b3 scale. In Splam, we set\n\n\u03b3 = 2 . In summary, focal loss quantifies the level of inaccuracy in predictions by down\nweighting the influence of easy examples during training, enabling the model to swiftly\nprioritize challenging examples.\n\n**Paralogs removal in testing dataset**\n\nWe removed the paralogs from the testing dataset as follows: we first split the transcripts on Chromosomes 1 and 9 and the remaining chromosomes and extracted the\ntranscript sequences using gffread  into two FASTA files. We then used nucmer \nwith default parameters to align the two files and ran show-coords with the -lcr option\nto obtain the alignment coordinates. We removed alignments with sequence similarity\ngreater than 80% and the alignment coverage percentage for the query greater than 50%.\nWe found a total of 2943 paralogous transcripts, and any splice sites in the testing dataset that were from these paralogs were removed.\n\nFor Splam model testing, we randomly selected 10,000 splice sites from the paralog\nremoved testing dataset for each of the four test set groups.\n\n**Testing SpliceAI**\n\nIn order to achieve optimal results with SpliceAI, the final splice site score was determined by averaging the outputs of five models, as recommended by the developers\nof SpliceAI. Troughout our experiments, we employ this ensemble approach for all\nSpliceAI analyses.\n\n**Running Splam on closely related and distant non-human species**\n\nIn this experiment, we aimed to evaluate Splam\u2019s ability to generalize to different species\nby benchmarking the performance of Splam against SpliceAI in scoring donor\u2013acceptor\nsite pairs. Tus, we took the same approach as described in Results: \u201cSplam: an accurate\nsplice junction recognition model\u201d and ran both programs at the splice junction level:\ncollecting junctions from non-human species and evaluating one junction at a time.\n\n**Extracting splice junctions from GFF fles as the positive testing dataset**\n\nWe downloaded the target non-human reference annotations in GFF format, along\nwith assembly reports and genome sequences in FASTA format, from the NCBI FTP\nserver (specifically, Pan troglodytes and Mus musculus) and TAIR database (Arabidopsis\n_[thaliana) at https:// www. arabi dopsis. org/. For each genome, we filtered out any incor-](https://www.arabidopsis.org/)_\nrectly overlapping exons and extracted introns from all isoforms of each gene as splice\n\n\n-----\n\njunctions using gffutils version 0.12.0 . Te final output of this step is a BED file with\nsupporting strand, parent ID, and chromosome information. Tis comprises the positive\ndataset to be used for evaluation.\n\n**Creating the negative testing dataset**\n\nTo produce compelling pseudo-splice-junction data for the negative dataset, we compiled the protein-coding genes for each species and followed a similar approach as in\nthe creation of the human Negative-Random dataset (Methods: \u201cNegative dataset creation\u201d). For each gene, we selected the strand opposite to the given protein-coding gene\nlocus. Second, we generated a random start position within the boundaries of the locus\nand searched forward until finding a canonical GT donor site if on the + strand, or CT\nacceptor site if on the \u2212 strand. If none were found, we ended the current attempt. Next,\nwe selected a random starting intron length from the interval , and jumped\nforward by this amount from the initial site. Starting from here, we searched forward to\nfind a canonical AG acceptor site if on the + strand, or AC donor site if on the \u2212 strand.\nIf none were found, we ended the current attempt. Otherwise, we recorded the donor\nsite and acceptor site positions as a splice junction. We repeated this process for a total\nof 20 attempts per gene locus to produce our negative dataset.\n\n**Processing splice junctions for Splam and SpliceAI**\n\nUsing the obtained coordinates from the positive and negative datasets, we pre-processed the splice junctions to fit the requirements for each model. For Splam, we\nextracted a 400-nt uppercase sequence for both donor and acceptor sites, as described in\nMethods: \u201cSplam input and output data encoding\u201d, resulting in an 800-nt input sequence\nfor each splice junction. In cases where the donor and acceptor sites were < 400 nt apart,\nwe allowed the flanking sequences to overlap in the intronic region, resulting in duplicated segments near the center of the input sequence. If the sites were exactly 200 nt\napart, the intronic flanking sequences of the two sites would be identical. In cases where\nthe sites were < 200 nt apart, we truncated the flanking sequences to the end of the\nintronic region (i.e., the donor or acceptor site itself) and padded the remainder with Ns.\nNo matter the case, the resulting input sequence would always be exactly 800 nt long.\n\nFor SpliceAI, we extracted the entire intron sequence with a 10,400nt context (5200\n\nnt flanking each side) as described in Methods: \u201cSpliceAI benchmarking\u201d. If the flanking sequence went out of the chromosome\u2019s range, we truncated to the boundary of the\nchromosome and padded the remainder with Ns. Tus, the length of the SpliceAI input\nsequence was 10.4#kb plus the intron length.\n\nIn order to run the SpliceAI models in a reasonable time, we randomly sampled 25,000\n\nsplice junctions from both the positive and negative datasets and ran Splam and SpliceAI\non each junction, following the protocols outlined in Methods: \u201cSpliceAI benchmarking\u201d.\n\n**Applying Splam to remove spurious spliced alignments**\n\nOne application of Splam is to remove spliced alignments with low-scoring splice junctions. Users can run Splam on alignment files (BAM). We assess the results at the intron\nlevel and the transcriptome assembly level.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample information of RNA-seq data**\n\nWe randomly selected 20 RNA-seq samples that were collected and sequenced by\nthe Lieber Institute for Brain Development. Among these samples, 10 were prepared\nusing poly-A capture and 10 were prepared using ribosomal RNA depletion. These\nsamples were obtained by the Lieber Institute from developing and mature human\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All FASTQ files of these samples are pub[licly available via Globus collections jhpce#bsp2-dlpfc at https:// app. globus. org/ file-](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=0dd03924-6853-11e9-bf44-0e4a062367b8&origin_path=%2F)\n[manag er? origin_ id= 0dd03 924- 6853- 11e9- bf44- 0e4a0 62367 b8& origin_ path=% 2F](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=0dd03924-6853-11e9-bf44-0e4a062367b8&origin_path=%2F)\nand jhpce#bsp2-hippo at [https:// app. globus. org/ file- manag er? origin_ id= 96be2 0a2-](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=96be20a2-6853-11e9-bf44-0e4a062367b8&origin_path=%2F)\n[6853- 11e9- bf44- 0e4a0 62367 b8& origin_ path=% 2F. We then aligned these samples to](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=96be20a2-6853-11e9-bf44-0e4a062367b8&origin_path=%2F)\nGRCh38 version 40 patch 14 with HISAT2.\n\n**Splam removal procedure workfow overview**\n\nSplam removal procedure would occur as a step in RNA-seq data analysis after\nspliced alignment and before transcriptome assembly (Fig.#5a). The Splam removal\nstep is highlighted by the red box, and a detailed breakdown of the trimming process\nis presented in Fig.#5b.\n\nBefore running the Splam spliced alignment removal procedure, users need to pre\npare three files, which are (1) a target alignment file in BAM format, (2) a reference genome in FASTA format, and (3) the released Splam model in PT format. This\nworkflow can be done in three lines of code:\n\n1. Extracting splice junctions from the alignment file:\n$ splam extract \u2212 P \u2212 o tmp_out < INPUT alignment file >\n2. Scoring extracted splice junctions:\n$ splam score \u2212 G < INPUT reference genome > \u2212 m < INPUT splam\n\nmodel > \u2212 o tmp_out tmp_out/junction.bed\n\nIn this step, Splam takes the splice junctions in the BED file generated in the pre\nvious step, encodes the data described in Methods: \u201cSplam input and output data\nencoding\u201d, and scores them using the trained Splam model (see Methods: \u201cSplam\nmodel architecture design\u201d and \u201cModel training and testing\u201d). Splam automatically\ndetects the environment and runs in \u201ccudo\u201d mode if CUDA is available. If the computer is running macOS, Splam will check if mps mode is available. If neither \u201ccuda\u201d\nnor \u201cmps\u201d are available, Splam will run in \u201ccpu\u201d mode.\n\n3. Cleaning up the alignment file:\n$ splam clean \u2212 o tmp_out\nSubsequently, Splam proceeds to iterate through the alignments. Splam can run\n\non alignment files of both single-end and paired-end RNA-seq samples. Any alignment containing any spurious splice junctions is removed, and if it is paired, Splam\nupdates the flags to unpair reads for both the aligned read and its mate. Moreover,\nif a read is multi-mapped, Splam updates the NH tag for the alignment itself and all\nother alignments. The outcome of this spliced alignment removal step is a cleaned,\nsorted alignment file (BAM) along with an alignment file comprising the discarded\nalignments.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Metrics for intron matching**\n\nTwo metrics, intron precision and recall, are used to assess the alignment file at the\nintron level. Intron precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the\nsum of true positives and false positives (TP + FP), where TP represents the number\nof introns in the alignment file that match the RefSeq annotation, while FP represents\nthe number of introns in the alignment file that do not match the annotation. Intron\nrecall, on the other hand, is computed as TP/(TP + FN). In this case, TP again represents the number of introns in both the alignment and the RefSeq annotation, while\nFN denotes the number of introns present in the annotation file but not in the alignment file.\n\n**Metrics for transcript assembly**\n\nIn evaluating the assembled transcripts, we examined two metrics: the total number\nof assembled transcripts that match the RefSeq database and the transcript precision.\nTranscript precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true\npositives and false positives (TP + FP). Here, TP represents the assembled matching\ntranscripts, while FP represents the hypothetical transcripts. Te transcript precision\nreflects the proportion of assembled transcripts that are actually inside the annotation file.\n\n**Applying Splam to score introns in annotation fles and assembled transcripts**\n\nUsers can run Splam on (1) annotation files or (2) assembled transcripts in three\nlines of code. Splam iterates through the GFF file, extracts all introns in transcripts,\nand writes their coordinates into a BED file. Te BED file consists of six columns:\nCHROM, START, END, JUNC NAME, INTRON NUM, and STRAND. Splam scores\nevery extracted intron and outputs the scores of each donor and acceptor site.\n\n$ splam extract \u2212 o tmp_out < INPUT annotation file >\n$ splam score\u2212 G < INPUT reference genome > \u2212 m < INPUT Splam model > \u2212 o\n\ntmp_out tmp_out/junction.bed\n\nLast, users can generate reports on the number of low-scoring splice junctions\n\nin each transcript and filter out transcripts with a high ratio of bad splice junctions\nusing a user-defined threshold.\n\n$ splam clean \u2212 o tmp_out\n\n**SpliceAI benchmarking**\n\nAll the experiments of SpliceAI are conducted on a 24-core, 48-thread Intel(R)\nXeon(R) Gold 6248R Linux computer with 1024#GB memory, running in \u201ccpu\u201d mode\nand using a single thread of execution.\n\n**Formatting SpliceAI input and output data**\n\nTe SpliceAI model requires a 10,000-nt context to run, meaning that the input\nsequence needs to be padded with 5000 nt of flanking sequence on either side. We\nincluded the full intron sequence plus an additional 200 nt before and after, to ensure\nthat SpliceAI had at least as much input sequence as Splam. In the \u201cSpliceAI\u201d version,\n\n\n-----\n\nwe extracted the full 5.2-kb flanking sequence from the genome (Additional file# 1:\nFig S2a). In the \u201cSpliceAI-10#k-Ns\u201d version, we replaced the outer 5000 nt on each\nflanking sequence with Ns (zero-padding, as outlined in ), leaving only a 200nt sequence from the genome. Although SpliceAI outputs scores for every position\ninside the 10-kb flanking sequences, for evaluation we only extracted the scores for\nthe donor and acceptor sites.\n\n**Testing the SpliceAI model**\n\nPursuant to the methods described in , we ran SpliceAI on large datasets in discrete batches, with a batch size of 500 splice junctions. We one-hot encoded the input\nsequence, loaded the resulting tensor into the SpliceAI model, and extracted the output\ninto donor, acceptor, and non-splice-site channels. Each channel was a list containing\nthe corresponding scores for every nucleotide in the input sequence. Te channels were\nthen written to their respective files, with every line representing a different splice junction. We repeated this process for all 5 SpliceAI models, then averaged the donor and\nacceptor site scores.\n\n**Executing and speeding up SpliceAI predictions**\n\nIn order to do batch prediction, we created a separate bash script to execute the above\nmodel testing process in increments of 500 (batch size), up to the size of the input dataset. We employed a wrapper script for ease of access and to prevent memory leakage.\n\nAdditionally, to speed up the pipeline across models and for both \u201cnoN\u201d and \u201cN\u201d\n\nmodes, we multi-threaded the bash execution to run the 10 targets (5 models, 2 modes)\nconcurrently.\n\n**Supplementary Information**\n\n[The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13059- 024- 03379-4.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-024-03379-4)\n\n\nAdditional file 1: Supplementary Note S1-S4, supplementary Fig S1-S15, and supplementary Table S1-S12.\n\nAdditional file 2: Review history.\n\n\n**Acknowledgements**\nWe thank Markus J.

First, we find that a joint\nevaluation of small and structural variants uniformly reduces measured errors\nfor SNPs (\u2212 28.9%), INDELs (\u2212 19.3%), and SVs (\u2212 52.4%) across three datasets. vcfdist\nalso corrects a common flaw in phasing evaluations, reducing measured flip errors\nby over 50%. Lastly, we show that vcfdist is more accurate than previously published\nworks and on par with the newest approaches while providing improved result\ninterpretability.\n\n**Keywords: Benchmarking, Variant calling, Structural variation, Single-nucleotide**\npolymorphism, Insertion, Deletion, Comparison, Phasing\n\n\n**Background**\n\nPrior to the invention of DNA sequencing, structural variants (SVs) larger than 3 Mb\nwere observed using a microscope as early as 1959 . Following the initial sequencing of the human genome in 2001 using short read technologies , however, the focus\nof most research investigations shifted to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and\nsmall insertions and deletions (INDELs). It quickly became apparent that SNPs are the\nmost common form of genetic variation, accounting for the approximately 0.1% difference in genomic sequence between two individuals , or about 3.1 million SNPs. Shortread technologies were well-poised to investigate these differences, due to their short\nread lengths but high per-base accuracy. It has since been determined that though SVs\nand INDELs are less common than SNPs, due to their larger size they account for a further 1.4% difference in genome composition between individuals , or about 43.2 million bases.\n\nA few years later, in 2009, the first tools to identify structural variants from short\nread alignments were developed . Although short-read based structural variant callers remain widely used, they have relatively low recall (10\u201370%) due to the\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.

Te accurate detection of structural variants was greatly assisted by the\ndevelopment of new long-read sequencing technologies around 2014, most notably\nfrom Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) . Although early iterations of each technology had much lower per-base accuracy\nrates of around 85% , longer read lengths led to unambiguous read mappings\nand more accurate structural variant calls . Since then, accuracy has improved\nand both PacBio and ONT can sequence reads above 15 Kb with 99 to 99.9% accuracy, rivaling the accuracy of short reads . As shown in Fig. 1, this has led to\nthe recent development of variant calling pipelines built from long-read sequencing\ndata .\n\nOnce small and structural variants have been called, accurate comparison of variant\n\ncall files (VCFs) is important for (1) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) , (2) precision medicine , (3) variant annotation and effect prediction ,\n(4) sequencing and variant calling pipeline benchmarking , and (5) variant\ndatabase curation . In short, accurate VCF comparison is necessary for studying the impacts of genetic variants, for understanding the performance of variant calling methods, and for making decisions based on an individual\u2019s genetic composition.\nTis information can then be used to identify mutations that cause genetic diseases,\nto select the best variant calling pipeline for clinical usage, to develop targeted drugs,\nand to direct future research and funding.\n\nAlthough small and structural variant calls can now be made from the same analy\nsis pipeline, the current standard practice for VCF benchmarking involves separating small variants (smaller than 50 bp) from structural variants (larger than 50 bp)\nprior to benchmarking (see Fig. 1). Tis 50-bp threshold was selected for historical\nand technical reasons related to the limitations of short-read sequencing, not because\na 50-bp threshold is biologically significant in any way . Short-read sequencing\u2019s variant calling performance is lower for INDELs larger than 50-bp because the\nmappability of a 150-bp read containing such a large variant is significantly reduced.\nFor this reason, variants below and above this size threshold have been historically\nevaluated separately. Prematurely categorizing variant calls into small and structural\n\n**Fig. 1** **a Until recently, small and structural variants were called separately using different pipelines because**\nthey required different DNA sequencing technologies: short reads cannot be unambiguously mapped to\ncall many structural variants accurately, and long reads were not accurate enough for precise small variant\ncalling. b Due to recent improvements in long-read sequencing accuracy, whole genome sequencing\n(WGS) pipelines can now identify both small and structural variants (SVs) from the same sequencing data.\nIt is still standard practice to evaluate these variant call categories separately, however, using vcfeval  for\nsmall variants and Truvari bench  for large INDELs and SVs. c We propose joint benchmarking of small\nand structural variant calls in this work, by extending vcfdist  to evaluate SVs. By comparing query and\ntruth variants across size categories, vcfdist is able to detect a greater number of equivalent truth and query\nvariants. This improves benchmarking accuracy, as shown in Fig. 2\n\n\n-----\n\nvariants prior to benchmarking has a significant impact on measured variant calling\nperformance (see Fig. 2), since several smaller variants are frequently equivalent to\none or several larger variants.\n\nTe variant call file (VCF) format was first defined in 2011, and a simple exact variant\n\ncomparison engine was released at the same time as part of vcftools . vcfeval was\nintroduced by Real Time Genomics (RTG) in 2015 and is capable of handling equivalent\nvariant representations . It was designed to evaluate unphased small variant calls,\nrequires exact matches, and evaluates variants up to 1000 bp in size. vcfeval has stood\nthe test of time, being the recommended small variant calling evaluator by the Global\nAlliance for Genomics and Global Health (GA4GH) in 2019 . In 2023, vcfdist was\nreleased to evaluate locally phased small variant calls from long-read sequencing pipelines, relaxing vcfeval\u2019s requirement that variants match exactly .\n\nMost structural variant calling evaluators similarly allow inexact variant matches. Tru\nvari bench, for example, considers two structural variants equivalent if they are located\nnearby on the reference, are of similar total size, overlap one another, and have a 70%\nsimilar sequence . Although Truvari bench is able to perform whole genome SV\ncomparison, it ignores small INDELs under 50 bp by default and is not currently recommended for evaluating SNPs . Truvari\u2019s refine module extends Truvari bench using\nan alignment algorithm (WFA , MAFFT , or POA ) to harmonize phased\n\n**Fig. 2** We evaluated three phased HG002 whole genome sequencing (WGS) variant callsets (described\nin Additional File 1: Table S1) on the whole-genome GIAB-Q100 benchmarking BED regions for small and\nstructural variants using vcfdist. We show that compared to existing methodologies, which evaluate small\nvariants (in purple) and structural variants (in red) separately, evaluating all variants at once (in green) leads\nto higher measured performance for each variant category. a False negative rate (FNR) and b false discovery\nrate (FDR) decrease when all variants are evaluated together, across all datasets. This occurs because correctly\ndetermining variant equivalence sometimes requires considering variants from multiple categories. Please\nnote that results are plotted on a logarithmic scale\n\n\n-----\n\nquery and truth VCF variant representations for benchmarking INDELs and SVs at least\n5 bp in size .\n\nIn this work, we extend vcfdist to be the first tool to jointly evaluate phased SNP,\n\nINDEL, and SV calls for whole-genome datasets. Doing so required major internal\nrestructuring and improvements to vcfdist to overcome scalability issues relating to\nmemory and compute requirements. We show that performing a joint analysis of all\nvariant sizes leads to better measured overall accuracy than when evaluating small and\nstructural variants separately, reducing measured false negative and false positive variant calls by 28.9% for SNPs, by 19.3% for INDELs, and by 52.4% for SVs of over 50 bases.\nWe find that vcfdist\u2019s alignment-based analysis obtains more accurate results than vcfeval or Truvari bench and similar accuracy results to Truvari refine, but provides more\ninterpretable results because the representation of evaluated truth and query variants\nis unchanged. Finally, we jointly evaluate SNP, INDEL, and SV phasing and show that\nbetween 42.6% and 92.2% of all phasing flip \u201cerrors\u201d that popular phasing analysis tool\nWhatsHap reports are false positives. Differing variant representations cause variants to\nappear incorrectly phased, though they are not. Tese false positive flip errors then lead\nto false positive switch errors, which will significantly affect downstream tertiary analyses. We demonstrate that vcfdist is able to avoid these errors in phasing analysis by using\nalignment-based variant comparison.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Joint evaluations allow variant matches across size categories and increase measured**\n\n**performance**\n\nIn order to understand the impact of jointly benchmarking small and structural variants on measured accuracy, we evaluated three whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets with vcfdist using several different variant subsets from the truth and query VCFs.\nMore information on these WGS datasets can be found in the \u201cMethods\u201d section and\nAdditional File 1: Table S1. Figure 2 shows that compared to existing methodologies,\nwhich evaluate small variants (in purple) and structural variants (in red) separately,\njointly evaluating all variants (in green) leads to lower measured error rates for each\nvariant category.\n\nIn Fig. 2, the hifiasm-dipcall dataset uses alignment parameters which are identical to\n\nthe draft benchmark Q100-dipcall VCF. As a result, it sees the lowest rates of improvement from a joint evaluation of small and structural variants: a 4.6% reduction in SNP\nerrors, a 1.2% reduction in INDEL errors, and a 24.9% reduction in SV errors. Te\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR VCF uses the same assembly as hifiasm-dipcall with very different\nalignment parameters and therefore sees great benefits from a joint evaluation: a 62.5%\nreduction in SNP errors, a 34.8% reduction in INDEL errors, and a 75.3% reduction\nin SV errors. Te Q100-PAV VCF lies somewhere between these two extremes, with a\n19.5% reduction in SNP errors, a 21.7% reduction in INDEL errors, and a 57.0% reduction in SV errors. A visualization of the alignment parameters used for each dataset is\nincluded in Additional File 1: Fig. S1.\n\nTese performance improvements originate from cases where multiple smaller vari\nants are found to be nearly or exactly equivalent to one or several larger variants. Figure 3 shows an example where this occurs and a joint evaluation of small and structural\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 3** An example from the Q100-PAV HG002 variant callset (chr1:3,287,250-3,287,700\non GRCh38) where using vcfdist to jointly evaluate small and structural variants improves measured\nperformance. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are marked with black crosses, and deletions are\nrepresented as red rectangles. A joint evaluation of all variants discovers that truth and query haplotypes are\nidentical, despite variant representation differences. The truth VCF contains a 145 base deletion, whereas the\nquery VCF contains a 47 base deletion, a 1 base deletion, and a 97 base deletion. By prematurely categorizing\nvariants prior to evaluation into small and structural variants, this equivalence cannot be determined and\nvariants would be classified as false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) variant calls instead of true positives\n(TP). Only by jointly evaluating the small and large deletions can vcfdist detect that such complex variants are\nin fact equivalent\n\n**Table 1 Comparison of WhatsHap compare and vcfdist phasing evaluations relative to the Q100-**\ndipcall truth VCF on the whole-genome GIAB-Q100 BED\n\n**Dataset** **Tool** **Measured switch errors** **Measured**\n**fip errors**\n\nhifiasm-dipcall WhatsHap 610 396\n\nvcfdist 494 390\n\nQ100-PAV WhatsHap 324 433\n\nvcfdist 6 52\n\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR WhatsHap 1074 1004\n\nvcfdist 494 396\n\nWhatsHap consistently reports more switch and fip errors than vcfdist. We demonstrate in Additional File 1: Fig. S3 that\nmost of these supposed phasing errors are actually correctly phased and provide an example in Fig. 4\n\nvariants improves measured performance. A similar example containing sequence\ninformation in VCF format is provided in Additional File 1: Fig. S2.\n\n**Sophisticated variant comparison techniques result in better phasing evaluations**\n\nTo understand joint phasing evaluation accuracy, we compare vcfdist to WhatsHap, a\ncurrent standard for phasing evaluation . WhatsHap\u2019s compare module performs\none-to-one variant comparisons between truth and query VCFs to evaluate phasing correctness. For each heterozygous query variant, WhatsHap searches for an identical truth\nvariant and notes whether that truth variant has the same or opposite phasing of the\ncorresponding query variant. Within each phase block, WhatsHap then uses a simple\ndynamic programming algorithm to minimize the total number of flip errors (in which\nthe phase of a single variant is mismatched) and switch errors (in which the phases of all\nfollowing variants are mismatched) . Although WhatsHap\u2019s approach seems intuitively correct, it breaks down in repetitive regions of the genome where differing variant\nrepresentations can result in false positive reported flip errors. Table 1 clearly shows that\nWhatsHap reports far more switch and flip errors than vcfdist on the exact same variant\ncalls, particularly for the Q100-PAV and hifiasm-GIAB-TR datasets.\n\nIn contrast to WhatsHap, vcfdist performs full alignment of all nearby truth and\n\nquery variants (a \u201csupercluster\u201d) and is able to discover equivalencies in variant\n\n\n-----\n\nrepresentations. As a result, vcfdist reports far fewer phasing errors. Te Q100-PAV\nVCF contains the fewest switch and flip errors, likely because it was produced using\nthe same verkko assembly as the draft benchmark Q100-dipcall VCF. For the hifiasmdipcall and hifiasm-GIAB-TR VCFs, vcfdist reports nearly identical switch and flip\nerror rates. We believe this is because they were both produced using the same hifiasm scaffold . In comparison, WhatsHap reports a much higher combined switch\nand flip error rate for the hifiasm-GIAB-TR VCF than for the hifiasm-dipcall VCF.\nWe expect this is because the variant representation used by the hifiasm-GIAB-TR\ncallset differs significantly from that used by the draft benchmark Q100-dipcall VCF,\nwhereas the parameters used by the hifiasm-dipcall VCF are identical (Additional File\n1: Fig. S1).\n\nIn Additional File 1: Fig. S3, we present an extensive comparison of the switch and\n\nflip errors reported by WhatsHap and vcfdist. We find that 42.6% of flip errors reported\nby WhatsHap proved to be false positives, since the truth and query sequences match\nexactly when all neighboring variants are considered. An example is shown in Fig. 4,\nwhere WhatsHap reports a flip error within a complex variant even though both truth\nand query haplotypes match exactly. A further 49.6% of the flip errors reported by WhatsHap were not classified as flip errors by vcfdist due to insufficient evidence. Since there\nwas no ground truth for these instances, we manually examined 16 random cases from\neach dataset (48 in total) where the ground truth was unknown. We found that classifying flip errors with WhatsHap resulted in 43 false positives, 4 true negatives, and 1 true\npositive. In comparison, classifying flip errors with vcfdist resulted in 40 true negatives, 7\nfalse positives, and 1 false negative when compared to a manual examination. As can be\nseen in Table 1, these excess false positive flip error calls by WhatsHap artificially inflate\nthe reported switch error rate as well, which will significantly impact tertiary analyses.\n\n**Fig. 4** **a The variant call file (VCF) for an example WhatsHap false positive flip error call. Each VCF record**\nshows the variant chromosome (CONTIG) and positions (POS) in addition to the reference (REF) and\nalternate (ALT) alleles and their genotypes (GT), the benchmarking decision (BD), and benchmarking credit\n(BC). In isolation, the two-base deletions at position 32,653,659 (the red and blue variants) appear to be the\nsame variant (because POS, REF, and ALT match) phased differently between the truth and query VCFs (i.e.,\na flip error). b The resulting haplotype sequences. When this supposed flip error is considered in the context\nof the surrounding variants, vcfdist is able to determine that the two sets of truth and query variant calls are\nequivalent because both truth and query haplotype sequences are exactly the same. Both truth haplotypes\ncontain an extra T at position 32,653,666 and one fewer T at positions 32,653,658-9. As a result, it is clear that\nno such flip error has occurred and differences between the truth and query VCF are due solely to differing\nvariant representations\n\n\n-----\n\n**vcfdist enables highly accurate comparisons with reasonable runtime**\n\nNext, we compare vcfdist to previously published works vcfeval  and Truvari\nbench , designed for evaluating small and structural variants, respectively. We also\nbenchmark the performance of Truvari\u2019s refine module, a recently developed extension which realigns truth and query variants to one another using MAFFT , wavefront alignment (WFA) , or partial-order alignment (POA)  for more accurate\nbenchmarking. Truvari refine achieves similar accuracy to vcfdist but changes the\ntotal counts of truth and query variants, making comparisons across different evaluation tools and pipelines difficult (see Table 3 for an example). All current versions of\nTruvari do not evaluate SNP accuracy, since Truvari was designed for SV evaluation.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, vcfeval only evaluates variants smaller than 1000\n\nbases. For this reason, we restrict the maximum variant size to 1Kb in Fig. 5. As variant length increases in Fig. 5, vcfeval reports an increasingly high error rate compared\nto vcfdist (90.6% higher for SNPs, 128% higher for INDELs, and 321% higher for SVs).\nTis is because vcfeval requires truth and query variants to match exactly (which\nis less likely for larger variants), whereas vcfdist and Truvari do not. A more lenient matching heuristic will lead to strictly fewer false positives and false negatives in\nFig. 5. To avoid falsely inflating vcfdist\u2019s performance, we set vcfdist\u2019s credit threshold\nto 70% in order to match Truvari\u2019s sequence similarity threshold of 70% as closely as\npossible. We additionally standardize the method of variant counting across all tools\nin Fig. 5 to be consistent with vcfdist because otherwise differences in counting credit\nfor partial allele matches would dominate the results (see Table 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 shows that vcfdist measures lower false negative and discovery rates for all\n\nvariant sizes across all three datasets when compared to previously published works Truvari bench and vcfeval. It is able to accomplish this by allowing inexact matches, evaluating groups of variants simultaneously, and allowing variant matches to occur across\nsize categories. In comparison to Truvari refine, vcfdist achieves a similar improvement\nin benchmarking accuracy but without modifying the variant representations during\nbenchmarking, and evaluating SNPs in addition to INDELs and SVs. Despite vcfdist\u2019s\nadvantages, we find that Truvari refine currently scales better with variant size, since\nit uses more memory-efficient alignment algorithms. We plan to incorporate wavefront\nalignment into the next release of vcfdist, but for now the maximum recommended variant length is 10 Kb. For more details on the advantages of WFA, see . Table 2\nshows the runtimes of vcfdist, vcfeval, Truvari bench, and Truvari refine on our server;\nconfiguration details are provided in the \u201cMethods\u201d section.\n\nBoth Truvari and vcfdist perform alignment-based evaluation, which allows detection\n\nof variant calls that are mostly but not exactly correct. By default, Truvari considers a\nvariant to be a true positive when the sequence similarity (percent of matching bases\ndivided by total sequence length) exceeds 70%. We set vcfdist\u2019s default credit threshold\n(minimum percent reduction in edit distance when the reported variant is present) to\n70% to match this. In practice, this is only slightly more stringent than Truvari\u2019s criterion (see \u201cDifferent thresholds\u201d in Table 4). Tis is crucial for identifying large structural\nvariants that are less likely to be called perfectly. In contrast, vcfeval finds matching subsets of truth and query variants that result in the exact same haplotype sequence. Tis\ncomputation would be less expensive if not for the fact that vcfeval does not assume\nthe input VCFs are phased. Because there are 2[n] possible phasings for _n heterozygous_\nvariants, vcfeval\u2019s runtime depends more closely on the number and representation of\nvariants than either Truvari or vcfdist. As a result, vcfeval has a wide range of runtimes.\nIt is also important to note that when the number of nearby heterozygous variants is too\nlarge, vcfeval fails to compare these variants. Tis happened for 9712 variants (0.20%)\non the hifiasm-dipcall VCF, for 21,886 variants (0.45%) on the Q100-PAV VCF, and for\n136,073 variants (2.50%) on the hifiasm-GIAB-TR VCF.\n\nTe runtimes of vcfdist and Truvari, on the other hand, depend closely on the size\n\nof the sequences to be aligned. Truvari reduces total runtime by evaluating variants\nin two stages; only complex regions are passed on to Truvari\u2019s refine module for more\nsophisticated evaluation. vcfdist segments contigs into independent superclusters using\n\n**Table 2 Runtime results for vcfdist, vcfeval, Truvari bench, and Truvari refine in (h:)mm:ss format**\n\n**GIAB-Q100 BED Runtime**\n\n**hifasm-dipcall** **Q100-PAV** **hifasm-GIAB-TR**\n\n**vcfdist** 52:19 1:04:56 59:22\n\n**vcfeval** 14:40 50:39 46:18\n\n**Truvari bench** 10:03 10:59 10:46\n\n**Truvari refne (MAFFT)** 14:10 23:08 22:36\n\n**Truvari refne (WFA)** 12:26 1:13:53 1:24:03\n\n**Truvari refne (POA)** 11:57 21:47 24:39\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3 Comparison of tools evaluating the** chr6:32,664,600-32,664,899 region of the\nHLA-DQB1 gene\n\n**SNP results** **INDEL results** **SV results**\n\n**Truth** **Query** **Truth** **Query** **Truth** **Query** **Total**\n\n**TP** **FN** **TP** **FP** **TP** **FN** **TP** **FP** **TP** **FN** **TP** **FP** **FN** **FP**\n\nvcfdist hifiasm-dipcall 32 0 32 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nQ100-PAV 32 0 66 0 2 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR 32 0 71 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nvcfeval hifiasm-dipcall 14 0 14 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nQ100-PAV 13 0 13 4 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4\n\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR 12 0 12 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4\n\nTruvari bench hifiasm-dipcall - - - - 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nQ100-PAV        -        -        -        - 2 0 2 1 0 2 0 0 2 1\n\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR         -         -         -         - 1 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0\n\nTruvari refine hifiasm-dipcall - - - - 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nQ100-PAV        -        -        -        - 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR         -         -         -         - 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAll three query VCFs called both haplotype sequences exactly correct; the resulting sequences are shared in Additional\nFile 1: Fig. S4.

Prior to evaluation, truth and query VCFs were normalized\nusing Truvari phab. This means that the Truvari results reported in this fgure are largely equivalent to Truvari refne (MAFFT).\nVariants that were not evaluated uniformly by the three tools are categorized and counted. Each category is described in\ngreater detail within the manuscript text and an example provided in Additional File 1: Fig. S6\n\n\n-----\n\nheuristics or a bidirectional wavefront algorithm (biWFA) , as shown in Additional\nFile 1: Table S2.\n\n**An example of benchmarking interpretability for the HLA-DQB1 gene**\n\nTe results of variant call benchmarking tools such as vcfeval, Truvari, and vcfdist are\nfrequently used in downstream tertiary analyses. In order to compare the interpretability of these tools, we evaluated the chr6:32,664,600-32,664,899 region of the\nHLA-DQB1 gene, since it is known to cause difficulties during analysis arising from differing variant representations. Te HLA-DQB1 gene is part of a family of genes called\nthe human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and plays an essential role in the human\nimmune system. Deleterious mutations in HLA-DQB1 are highly associated with common autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease  and multiple sclerosis (MS) .\n\nWe found through a manual examination that all three query VCFs called both hap\nlotype sequences in this region exactly correct. A summary of these results is shown in\nTable 3, and the resulting sequences are included in Additional File 1: Fig. S4. Although\nall sequences were the same, there were significant differences in how this genetic variation was represented. Compared to the first Q100-dipcall haplotype, the Q100-PAV and\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR VCFs chose to represent a 169-base insertion and a 168-base deletion\nas a 1-base insertion and 34 SNPs. Relative to the second Q100-dipcall haplotype, the\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR VCF chose to represent a 1-base insertion and 1-base deletion as 5\nSNPs. Tese differences account for the wide range of query true positive variant counts\nin Table 3.\n\nNote that because both truth sequences were called exactly correct, there should be no\n\nfalse negative (FN) or false positive (FP) variant calls counted, and the number of truth\nVCF true positives (TP) should be consistent across all three datasets. vcfdist correctly\ncounts all variants, as expected. vcfeval correctly counts the SVs but fails to evaluate\na large number of the SNP and INDEL variants because there are too many heterozygous variants in close proximity. It excludes these variants from the analysis and proceeds with a warning that the region is too complex to be evaluated. Truvari bench does\nnot evaluate the SNPs and fails to identify several of the INDELs and SVs. Tis failure\noccurs because it discards the SNPs prior to evaluation and therefore does not discover\nthe two cases where numerous SNPs are equivalent to an insertion and deletion. Truvari\nrefine also does not evaluate SNPs. It is able to detect that all variant calls are correct,\nthough it does convert both query and truth SVs to an INDEL for the Q100-PAV and\nhifiasm-GIAB-TR datasets.\n\n**Validation of vcfdist**\n\nLastly, we compare vcfdist to existing variant calling evaluation tools in order to verify\nits correctness. Following variant normalization (described in the \u201cMethods\u201d section),\nwe organize all variants evaluated by vcfdist, vcfeval, and Truvari in Table 4. 57,865 SNPs\nin this region are excluded from Table 4 because they were not evaluated by Truvari;\nwe include these results in Additional File 1: Fig. S5a. An additional 723 INDELs and\nSVs occurring at the border of the GIAB-TR BED regions are excluded because they\nwere only analyzed by some of the VCF comparison tools. Variants are then categorized\nbased on the apparent reason for differences in evaluated correctness between the three\n\n\n-----\n\ntools and counted. An example from each of the seven discovered categories is shown in\nAdditional File 1: Fig. S6 and described in further detail below.\n\nFirstly, all three tools handle allele matches differently, which accounts for the major\nity of differences in Table 4. Truvari will match a query homozygous variant to a truth\nheterozygous variant and consider both to be true positives. vcfeval will perform the\nsame match but consider the variants to be a false positive and false negative. vcfdist\nwill match the heterozygous variant to one haplotype of the homozygous variant, consider both to be true positives, and then consider the second haplotype of the query\nhomozygous variant to be a false positive. None of these methods is best; rather, each\nhas strengths for certain applications. We caution that users consider these performance\ndifferences based on their downstream goals.\n\nTe second most common area of disagreement between tools stems from the fact\n\nthat they have different thresholds for considering variant calls to be true positives. For\nexample, vcfeval requires variants to match exactly, whereas vcfdist requires variants to\nhave a partial credit score above 0.7 and Truvari requires a sequence similarity above 0.7.\nFor certain edge cases, such as where a length three deletion is called length four, even\nTruvari and vcfdist may differ.\n\nTe next most common differences are intentional implementation differences\n\nbetween the tools. In particular, vcfdist refuses to split a complex variant into multiple\nvariants and consider only a subset of those to be correct. Truvari, by default, only allows\na variant to participate in one match (with the \u2014-pick single parameter), regardless\nof allele count. vcfeval is the only tool that does not enforce local phasing and allows flip\nerrors of nearby variants to occur.\n\nLastly, there are rare cases where unintentional implementation differences lead to\n\nslightly differing results. Not all backtracking algorithms behave identically, leading to\ncases in which different algorithms will adjudicate which of a pair of variants is a false\npositive differently. Tere are also differences due to directly adjacent or overlapping\nvariants. For example, only vcfeval allows two separate insertions at the same exact location on the same haplotype and Truvari evaluates spanning deletions, whereas vcfeval\nand vcfdist do not.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that evaluating small and structural variants together is\nnecessary for discovering equivalent sets of truth and query variant calls. Furthermore,\nwe show that intelligent variant comparison, which is able to identify equivalent variant representations, is important for accurate phasing analyses. We then show that\nvcfdist is now able to scale to whole-genome analysis of phased SNPs, INDELs, and\nSVs with improved accuracy over prior work. Lastly, we describe and explain the differences between vcfdist and prior work as they relate to our variant calling benchmarking\nresults.\n\nAs variant calling performance improves and increasingly complex clusters of vari\nants are evaluated, minor differences in the implementations of evaluation tools such\nas Truvari, vcfeval, and vcfdist begin to significantly impact the results. Currently, the\nway each tool handles partially correct variant calls differs greatly. Partial correctness\ncan occur in many ways: a single insertion is called mostly but not entirely correct, a\n\n\n-----\n\nhomozygous variant is called heterozygous (genotype error), a deletion is called with the\nincorrect length, a heterozygous variant is called on the wrong haplotype (flip error), or\nonly a subset of several variants that comprise a complex variant are called. In Table 4,\nwe show that differences in how these cases are handled lead to significant differences in\nthe reported summary metrics (Fig. 5). Ideally, as a community we would define a standard methodology to handle each of these cases and clearly delineate how to count and\ncategorize these errors. While the GA4GH Benchmarking Team set an initial standard\nfor counting small variant genotype errors as both FPs and FNs, and report a separate\nmetric for number of genotype errors, we will need new standards for complex small\nand structural variants . In the absence of a standardized approach, it is important\nthat users of variant calling evaluation tools understand how each tool handles these\ncases, and the impact that may have on their results.\n\nIn this work, we have revisited some of the earlier design decisions we made in vcfdist\n\nv1. Although we still believe that total alignment distance is a useful supplementary metric to precision and recall curves, we now skip this computation by default, and allow\nre-enabling it with the \u2014-distance parameter. We believe that stratifying precision\nand recall curves by variant size offers many of the same benefits, with a more easily\ninterpretable result. We have also replaced variant calling partial credit with a credit\nthreshold \u2014-credit-threshold [0.7]. Partial credit is still calculated, but rather\nthan assigning partial false and true positives (which is unnecessarily complicated and\nnon-intuitive), we allow the user to select a partial credit threshold above which variants\nare considered true positives and below which variants are considered false positives.\nTis more closely aligns with the behavior of other structural variant calling benchmarking tools such as Truvari. Lastly, vcfdist no longer realigns truth and query variants to a\nstandard normalized representation by default. We found this behavior to be undesirable\nin Truvari refine because it complicates comparisons with other pipelines or datasets.\nvcfdist still retains this capability, however, which can be enabled using \u2014-realignquery and \u2014-realign-truth. Although we no longer enable this feature by default,\nwe urge individuals benchmarking variant calling pipelines to be aware of the variant\nrepresentations used in their truth and query VCFs.\n\nAt the moment, vcfdist is designed to compare phased variants from a single sam\nple query VCF to a truth VCF. We plan to extend vcfdist in the near future to handle\nunphased variant calls as well, since many genomic datasets do not contain phasing\ninformation. Along a similar vein, we would like for vcfdist to be able to work with\nmulti-sample population VCFs for use in genome wide association studies (GWAS). We\nbelieve joint evaluation of small and structural variants will be incredibly valuable in this\ncontext. In order to make this a reality, we will need to continue to improve the efficiency\nof vcfdist. Te alignment-based calculation of precision and recall will need to be shifted\nto a wavefront alignment based implementation , and when large or many nearby\nvariants are present, we may need to sacrifice accuracy in order to improve efficiency.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nRecent improvements in long-read sequencing accuracy have enabled calling phased\nsmall and structural variants from a single analysis pipeline. Despite this, the current\nstandard tools for variant calling evaluation are only designed for either small (vcfeval)\n\n\n-----\n\nor large (Truvari) variants. In this work we extend vcfdist\u2015previously a small variant\ncalling evaluator\u2015to evaluate structural variants, making it the first benchmarking\ntool to jointly evaluate phased single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions/deletions (INDELs), and structural variants (SVs) for the whole genome.\n\nWe find that a joint evaluation reduces measured false negative and false positive var\niant calls across the board: by 28.9% for SNPs, 19.3% for INDELs, and 52.4% for SVs\nover 50 bases. Building on vcfdist\u2019s alignment-based evaluation, we also jointly analyze\nphasing accuracy. vcfdist identifies that 43% to 92% of all flip errors called by standard\nphasing evaluation tool WhatsHap are false positives due to differences in variant representations. Lastly, we compare the accuracy of vcfdist to prior works and demonstrate\nthat it is able to find more true positive variant matches than vcfeval and Truvari bench.\nWe find that vcfdist performs similarly to Truvari refine, while also providing more easily interpretable results.\n\n**Methods**\n\nAll scripts described below are available in the GitHub repository [https:// github. com/](https://github.com/TimD1/vcfdist)\n[TimD1/ vcfdi st  in the analysis-v2/ subdirectory.](https://github.com/TimD1/vcfdist)\n\n**Datasets**\n\n**_Q100-dipcall VCF_**\n\nTe v0.9 Q100-dipcall draft benchmark VCF and its associated GIAB-Q100 BED containing small and structural variants were used as the ground truth VCF throughout this\nmanuscript . Tey were created during a collaboration between the Telomere-to[Telomere Consortium (T2T, https:// sites. google. com/ ucsc. edu/ t2two rking group/ home),](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup/home)\n[the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC, https:// human pange nome. org/),](https://humanpangenome.org/)\nand the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (GIAB, [https:// www. nist. gov/ progr ams- proje](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle)\n[cts/ genome- bottle) in an attempt to establish a diploid whole genome benchmark that](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle)\nis perfectly accurate. Te term \u201cQ100\u201d refers to a Phred quality score  of 100 or one\nerror per ten billion bases (i.e., zero expected errors per human genome). Te v0.9 draft\nbenchmark contains many errors, but improvements are still being made towards this\nultimate goal. A combination of data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT),\nPacific Biosciences high-fidelity sequencing (HiFi), Strand-Seq, and Hi-C were used in\ncombination with the trio-based verkko assembler  and manual review to create a\nhigh-quality assembly. Lastly, dipcall  was used to generate a VCF of this assembly\nrelative to the GRCh38 reference FASTA.\n\n**_Q100-PAV VCF_**\n\nTe same verkko assembly  was then used by researchers at the National Institute of\n[Standards and Technology (NIST, https:// nist. gov) to generate a second VCF using the](https://nist.gov)\nPhased Assembly Variant Caller (PAV) . For this reason, the Q100-PAV variant phasings match very closely with the Q100-dipcall phasings, as can be seen in Table 1. Note\nthat by default, PAV merges some non-identical haplotypes, resulting in inexact variant\ncalls.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_hifasm-dipcall VCF_**\n\nTe hifiasm-dipcall VCF was created by the HPRC using a combination of ONT ultralong (UL), HiFi, Hi-C, and Bionano optical mapping data . First, the trio-based hifiasm assembler  was used to create the initial assembly using HiFi and Hi-C data.\nBionano optical mapping data was used to verify these scaffolds, and a combination of\nmanual variant curation and polishing with ONT-UL data was used to generate the final\nassembly . Lastly, dipcall  was used to generate a VCF of this assembly relative to\nthe GRCh38 reference FASTA.\n\n**_hifasm-GIAB-TR VCF_**\n\nTe v4.20 hifiasm-GIAB-TR VCF and its associated GIAB-TR BED were generated\nby the Genome In A Bottle Consortium (GIAB) using the same hifiasm assembly,\nin addition to custom scripts that use minimap2 and paftools . Te methodology\nis described in detail in  and was part of an effort to create a high-quality tandem\nrepeat benchmark. Because the same hifiasm assembly was used, the phasing analysis\nresults of hifiasm-GIAB-TR closely match hifiasm-dipcall in Table 1, but the variant representation is much different than the other VCFs, as shown in Additional File 1: Fig. S1\n[(see https:// github. com/ ACEng lish/ adotto/ discu ssions/4 for details).](https://github.com/ACEnglish/adotto/discussions/4)\n\n**Preprocessing**\n\nPrior to evaluation, multi-allelic variants were split using bcftools norm v1.17  with\nthe -m-any parameter. Where required, the HG002 sample was extracted from the\noriginal VCF into a single-sample VCF using bcftools query.\n\n**Separate vs. joint evaluation of small and structural variants**\n\nFor each dataset, each subset (small variants (SNPs and INDELs) only, structural variants only, and all variants) of variants was first extracted into a separate VCF using\nbcftools view v1.17 . SVs were defined as insertions or deletions greater than or\nequal to 50 base pairs in size. INDELs are below this size threshold. vcfdist v2.5.0 \nwas used to compare each VCF to the Q100-dipcall ground truth within the GIABQ100 benchmarking regions. Scripts available in the small_sv_all/ directory of our\nGitHub repository  were used to calculate and plot the false negative and false discovery rates for each variant categorization within each VCF. Te results are shown in\nFig. 2.\n\n**Description of vcfdist phasing analysis**\n\nTe original vcfdist v1 release contained an experimental phasing analysis algorithm\nthat was untested and unready for production. In this work, we extended the original algorithm, described in , to perform a proper evaluation of phasing. First, we\nadded support for phase blocks using the input VCFs\u2019 FORMAT:PS fields. Unlike most\nother tools, vcfdist allows the ground truth VCF to contain phase sets as well. Using the\nreported phase sets, vcfdist now correctly identifies switch and flip errors. In addition to\nreporting detailed switch and flip error information, vcfdist also calculates several useful\nsummary metrics such as phase block NG50 (breaking regions on new phase blocks),\nswitch NGC50 (breaking regions on new phase blocks and switch errors), and switchflip\n\n\n-----\n\nNGC50 (breaking regions on new phase blocks, switch errors, and flip errors). Te\nNG50 metric reports the largest region such that all regions of that size and larger cover\nat least 50% of the genome. Lastly, we added a phasing threshold so that variant clusters are considered unphased unless one phasing significantly improves the cluster\u2019s edit\ndistance from the ground truth versus the other phasing. Te default value is set at \u2014\u2014\nphasing-threshold [0.6], or 60% reduction in edit distance, although the results\nfrom Additional File 1: Fig. S3c suggest that a higher threshold may be appropriate.\n\n**Phasing analysis comparison with WhatsHap**\n\nFirst, because WhatsHap does not allow providing a BED file to mask analysis regions,\nwe use bcftools filter v1.7  to restrict all three VCFs to the GIAB-Q100 benchmarking BED regions. We then performed phasing analyses using WhatsHap v2.1  and\nvcfdist v2.5.0 . We then used several scripts, available in the phasing/ directory\nof our GitHub repository , to compare and plot the resulting flip and switch errors\nreported by each tool. Te results are shown in Additional File 1: Fig. S3 and Table 1. In\nAdditional File 1: Fig. S3, a random subset of 16 clusters with unknown phasing from\neach VCF was selected and manually examined in order to define a ground truth and\ncompare vcfdist\u2019s and WhatsHap\u2019s performances on this subset of cases.\n\n**Accuracy comparison of variant calling evaluation tools**\n\nIn order to determine the differences in variant evaluation between vcfdist, vcfeval, Truvari bench, and Truvari refine, we evaluated all three datasets using each tool\non the GIAB-Q100 BED. We ran vcfdist v2.5.0  with -l 1000 to limit the maximum SV length because vcfeval does not consider variants larger than 1000 bases.\nWe ran rtg vcfeval v3.12.1  with the following parameters: \u2014-ref-overlap\n\u2014-all-records \u2014-vcf-score-field=QUAL. We ran Truvari bench v4.2.1 with\nthe following command line options: \u2014-no-ref a \u2014-sizemin 1 \u2014-sizefilt\n1 \u2014-sizemax 1000 \u2014-pick single \u2014-typeignore \u2014-dup-to-ins. We\nthen ran Truvari refine v4.2.1 using \u2014-regions candidate.refine.bed from the\nprevious Truvari bench step with the following parameters: \u2014-use-original-vcfs\n\u2014-use-region-coords \u2014-recount \u2014-align <method> where <method>\nwas WFA, MAFFT, and POA. We then merged results from Truvari refine and bench\nby subtracting the candidate.refine.bed (used by Truvari refine) from the GIABQ100 BED using bcftools subtract v1.17, evaluating the remaining regions with Truvari\nbench, and then merging the results. Lastly, we used several scripts, available in the vs_\nprior_work/ directory of our GitHub repository , to compare and plot the false\nnegative and false discovery rates of each tool. Tese results are shown in Fig. 5.\n\nTe same methodology was used to evaluate the example complex variant in the HLA\nDQB1 gene for each tool. Scripts are available in the hla/ directory of our GitHub\nrepository , and results are shown in Table 3.\n\n**Validation of vcfdist**\n\nIn order to validate the correctness of vcfdist\u2019s reported variant calling results, we needed\na way to compare how vcfdist classified a single variant to the classifications reported\nby prior works vcfeval and Truvari refine (MAFFT) for that same variant. We chose to\n\n\n-----\n\ncompare against Truvari refine instead of Truvari bench because it is more accurate .\nUnfortunately, Truvari refine changes the representations of the input truth and query\nvariants, making it difficult to compare benchmarking results across tools. Instead of\ndirectly using Truvari refine, we used an equivalent workflow that involves normalizing\nvariant representations using Truvari phab (which internally uses MAFFT) followed by\nTruvari bench evaluation. Tis approach enabled us to directly compare the decisions\nmade by vcfdist, vcfeval, and Truvari on the exact same set of variants while also enabling Truvari to be more accurate.\n\nWe first normalized chr20 of the GIAB-TR BED from each of our three VCFs with the\n\ntruth VCF using Truvari v4.2.1 phab (MAFFT). We then converted these VCFs into single sample VCFs of the desired format and split up multi-allelic variants using bcftools\nreheader, norm, and view v1.18 . Afterwards, we evaluated each VCF using vcfdist\nv2.5.0 , vcfeval v3.12.1 , and Truvari bench v4.2.1 . Scripts available in the\nphab_cm/ directory of our GitHub repository  were used to run and summarize\nthe evaluations. Te results are presented in Table 4, Additional File 1: Fig. S5, and Additional File 1: Fig. S6.\n\n**Improvements to the vcfdist clustering algorithm**\n\nA naive variant comparison algorithm would compare each query variant to a single reference variant individually in order to discover matches. While this approach works for\nthe majority of variant calls, there are cases where several query variants are equivalent to one or many truth variants (Additional File 1: Fig. S7a). Several examples of this\nare shown in Additional File 1: Fig. S8. Tis is especially true for repetitive regions of\nthe genome, or as the representations of the truth and query VCFs diverge. In order for\na benchmarking tool to recognize these cases of complex equivalency, all the variants\ninvolved must be evaluated at once in a group or \u201ccluster.\u201d\n\nTe default clustering algorithm employed by vcfdist discovers all cases in which vari\nants could participate in a complex match and groups those variants together into a single cluster. vcfdist achieves this by first initializing each cluster to a single variant. Next,\nthe leftmost and rightmost reference positions that can be reached by aligning through\neach cluster with an alignment cost less than or equal to the cost of the current variant\nrepresentation are recorded. If the reach of a cluster overlaps with the reach of a neighboring cluster, the two clusters are merged. Tis occurs until all clusters have stabilized.\n\nIn order to handle structural variants, vcfdist\u2019s original clustering algorithm (described\n\nbriefly above and in greater detail in ) was required to undergo significant changes\nto improve efficiency and reduce memory usage. Firstly, the bidirectional Smith-Waterman-Gotoh  algorithm used to calculate cluster left and right reaches was converted\nto a wavefront alignment based  equivalent in order to reduce memory usage from\n\nO(n) to O(n). Next, the alignment cost of each cluster was recalculated (and lowered,\n\nwhen possible) following each cluster merge in order to reduce unnecessary cluster\ngrowth in following iterations. Te left and right reaches of each cluster were cached\nacross iterations and only recalculated following a merge. A greedy merging strategy was\nemployed to merge multiple clusters at once when possible. Cluster reaches were calculated using iterative reach doubling to avoid unnecessary computation. Lastly, multithreading support was added for clustering.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison of vcfdist clustering methods**\nvcfdist v2.5.0 was run with \u201cgap _n\u201d clustering for_ n = (10, 100, 500) in addition to the\ndefault biWFA clustering using the command line options \u2014-cluster gap 10. Wall\nclock runtime was measured using the GNU time command on an Intel Xeon E5-2697\nv3 CPU, with 56 threads and 64GB RAM. Scripts used to calculate the cluster sizes\nshown in Additional File 1: Table S2 from vcfdist\u2019s verbose outputs are available in the\nclustering/ directory of our GitHub repository .\n\n**Extending vcfdist to evaluate structural variants**\n\nIn order to evaluate larger structural variants using vcfdist, we made several changes\nsuch as introducing command line parameter \u2014-largest  to control the size\nof variants evaluated by vcfdist. We also added summary metric reporting for structural variants separately from INDELs and added the \u2014-sv-threshold  flag\nto control the threshold for this classification. In addition to the numerous clustering\nefficiency improvements mentioned above, we decreased the memory usage of the precision and recall calculations. Since each cluster can be evaluated independently, we\nalso added multi-threading and work balancing based on cluster size for all intra-cluster\ncomputations.\n\n**Runtime comparison of variant calling evaluation tools**\n\nVariants larger than 1000 bp were pre-filtered using bcftools view v1.17 and inversions were filtered using GNU grep v2.20 because otherwise they significantly impact\nthe runtime of Truvari refine (even when excluded from the analysis with \u2014-sizemax 1000). Wall clock runtime was measured using the GNU time command on an\nIntel Xeon E5-2697 v3 CPU, with 56 threads and 64GB RAM. Te scripts with the exact\nparameters used to run each tool are available in the vs_prior_work/ directory of\nour GitHub repository . Te results are shown in Table 2.\n\n**Supplementary information**\n\n[The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13059- 024- 03394-5.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-024-03394-5)\n\n\nAdditional file 1.

However, extensive DNA rearran- gements arising through a series of mutations, a phenomenon we refer to as serial SV (sSV), remain underexplored, posing a challenge for SV discovery. Here, we present NAHRwhals (https://github.com/WHops/NAHRwhals), a method to infer repeat-mediated series of SVs in long-read genomic assem- blies. Applying NAHRwhals to haplotype-resolved human genomes from 28 individuals reveals 37 sSV loci of various length and complexity. These sSVs explain otherwise cryptic variation in medically relevant regions such as the TPSAB1 gene, 8p23.1, 22q11 and Sotos syndrome regions. Comparisons with great ape assemblies indicate that most human sSVs formed recently, after the human-ape split, and involved non-repeat-mediated processes in addition to non-allelic homologous recombination. NAHRwhals reliably discovers and characterizes sSVs at scale and independent of species, uncovering their genomic abundance and suggesting broader implications for disease.\n\n\nCheck for updates\n\n\nContinuous advances in single-molecule sequencing technologies drive\nthe discovery of increasingly complex patterns of genetic variation in\nthe human genome, particularly in repetitive regions. These highly\nrearranged regions and the respective complex alleles contribute to\npopulation diversity and impact a wide range of phenotypes[\u2013]. Investigating complex alleles in distinct population ancestries is important for\nelucidating their pathogenic impact, as well as their recent and past\nevolution. In spite of continued advances in genome assembly, we are\nfar from understanding the full spectrum of human genetic variation\nparticularly in repeat-rich genomic regions, leaving much of their impact\non evolution, diversity, and human diseases in the dark[\u2013].\n\nStructural variation (SV) in the genomes of humans and other\n\n\nanimals is increasingly characterized with complete allelic resolution,\n\n\ndriven by advances in long read and homolog-preserving genomic\ntechnologies[\u2013]. Recent long-read studies have revealed growing\nnumbers of rearrangements of a complexity that escape analysis using\nconventional short-read sequencing. These rearrangement patterns\nare caused either by (i) complex genomic rearrangement processes[,],\nor (ii) by serial rearrangement events that accumulated at a locus\ngradually over evolutionary times, or rapidly due to its tendency to\nundergo SV[,]. The latter events are presumed to be particularly\npredominant in genomic regions harboring segmental duplications\n(SDs), which facilitate de novo rearrangements via non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). This spatial preference makes their\ndiscovery and interpretation especially challenging \u2013 with short read\nbased mappers struggling in SD-rich regions \u2013 while raising the notion\n\n\n1European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Genome Biology Unit, Meyerhofstr. 1, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany. 2Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European\nMolecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

In light of their \u2018serial\u2019 nature,\nwe refer to the latter as serial structural variants (sSV) for the purpose\nof this manuscript.\n\nWhile the frequency of sSVs in healthy and diseased individuals is\n\npoorly explored, these regions are important for population and\nmedical genetics\u2014since they demarcate regions with high diversity in\nhaplotype structure, and regions prone to undergo de novo rearrangements including pathogenic copy-number variation (CNV)[,][\u2013]. As\npart of a comprehensive survey of polymorphic inversions in the\nhuman genome, we recently reported several isolated sSV-like\nevents, which included rearrangements that likely facilitate - or protect against - disease-causing copy number variations in the human\ngenomic loci 3q29, 15q13.3 and 7q11.23. In addition to this, a range of\nfurther studies reported medically relevant SD-associated CNVs that\ncould be interpreted as sSVs, including mutational events causative for\nthe Coffin-Siris syndrome, cone-rod dystrophy, intellectual disability\nand seizure and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in\n\npatients. Similarly, sSV events potentially causative for early-onset\nneuropsychiatric disorders and Angelman syndrome have been\nidentified. From a population genetics viewpoint, the TCAF1/2 locus\ndisplays substantial human-specific sSV-like copy-number variation\nassociated with positive selection and an implicated role in\n\nadaptation and the TBC1D3 gene family, similarly, displays remarkable human diversity attributable to sSVs implicated in the expansion\nof the human prefrontal cortex. Recently, the first pangenome-graph\nreference released by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium\n(HPRC) provided new insights into highly variable complex regions,\nsuch as the RHD, HLA-A, C4, CYP2D6 and LPA-containing loci, many of\nwhich harbor interspersed SDs and are thus likely candidates for sSV\nactivity. Indeed, for example, SD-associated variation in the LPA locus\nhas been reported to directly impact the risk for cardiovascular\ndiseases. Yet, despite their undisputed relevance, these regions\nremain poorly resolved and consequently understudied, owing to\nchallenges in the discovery and interpretation of genetic variation in\nthese regions.\n\nThe identification of sSVs using long-read sequencing[,] or long\nread based genome assemblies[,][,] is conceptually separate from\n\u2018classical\u2019 SV calling, as even a perfect description of sequence\nalterations (e.g., \u2018Del-Inv-Del\u2019) does not necessarily capture the series\nof underlying simple SVs (such as an inversion followed by a deletion,\ndenoted \u2018Inv + Del\u2019 in Fig. 1A). Even when this \u2018mechanistic\u2019 viewpoint is\nignored, only few methods for resolving complex patterns of SV have\nbeen developed, and these come with remaining limitations[,]. These\nlimitations include the need for specialized algorithms designed to\ncapture complex multi-breakpoint SVs thought to be formed through\na single mutational event dependent on the region of the genome\nthese tools are applied to. De novo genome assemblies, which since\nrecently achieve remarkable resolution across nearly the full human\ngenome, theoretically allow for a more comprehensive study of sSV.\nHowever, the identification of sSV from assemblies remains\n\nchallenging and to date has not been explicitly addressed through\ncomputational methods. Thus, novel methodologies are required to\naddress our current lack of detection and improve our understanding\nof how sSV contributes to genomic variation.\n\nTo directly address this existing gap, we devised a computational\n\nframework, NAHRwhals (NAHR-directed Workflow for catcHing seriAL\nStructural Variations), which allows to infer regions likely to have\nundergone consecutive overlapping SVs (i.e., sSVs). Given a genomic\nassembly and genomic reference coordinates of interest, NAHRwhals\nidentifies structural differences and NAHR-enabling repeats and\nemploys an exhaustive search over potential sSVs that can explain the\nobserved difference in sequence architectures\u2014to generate hypotheses about serial rearrangements resulting in sSVs across the genome.\nNAHRwhals thereby leverages the sequence resolution of genome\n\n\nassemblies, to enable identification of patterns of complex variation\notherwise inaccessible. The tool can be readily applied using any\ngenome assembly and a freely exchangeable reference sequence,\nmaking it suitable for comparative genomic analysis. Applying\nNAHRwhals, we reveal the occurrence of sSVs in 28 diploid genome\nassemblies\u20145 of which were previously unpublished \u2013 and highlight\nimplications in medically important regions.\n\n## Results\n#### Automated detection of serial structural variations (sSV) from genome assemblies\nWe developed the NAHRwhals framework to allow systematic identification of sSVs in haplotype-resolved genome assemblies. NAHRwhals\ncan be run in two primary modes: genotyping mode and wholegenome mode. The required inputs are:\n\n(1) Reference Genome (\u2018Ref \u2019): a reference FASTA file, such as\nGRCh38.\n\n(2) Query Genome (\u2018Query\u2019): A single-haplotype assembly FASTA file\nto be analyzed.\n\n(3) Regions of Interest (\u2018ROI\u2019s) - Required only in genotyping mode:\ncoordinates on the reference genome (\u2018Ref \u2019) to be genotyped. In\nwhole-genome mode, NAHRwhals automatically determines ROIs\nby conducting an initial alignment of the entire reference and\nquery genomes to identify discordant regions, which are then\nused as ROIs (\u201cMethods\u201d, Fig. S1).\n\nNAHRwhals genotypes any ROI in four steps: (i) isolating the ROI\n\nin Ref and locating its counterpart in Query, (ii) aligning the ROIsequences from Ref and Query, (iii) turning this pairwise alignment into\na simplified, \u2018segmented\u2019, representation which facilitates repeat discovery and SV simulation, and (iv) employing a depth-first search to\nfind sSV candidates that can rearrange the segments in Ref to mimic\ntheir order in Query (see also Fig. 1B; \u201cMethods\u201d). Below, we describe\nthese four steps in detail:\n\n#### i) Sequence retrieval\nThe ROI is extracted from the reference genome (Ref ), resulting in ROIRef. Minimap2 is then used to locate the corresponding, potentially\nSV-carrying, region in the query genome (Query), yielding ROI-Query.\n\n#### ii) Highly accurate pairwise alignments\nA pairwise alignment between ROI-Ref and ROI-Query is produced\nusing a custom pipeline. This pipeline involves splitting ROI-Query into\nchunks of 1 kbp, aligning these chunks to ROI-Ref individually (allowing\nfor multi-mappings), and subsequently re-joining them (\u201cMethods\u201d,\nFig. S2). This method significantly improves alignment quality in\nrepeat-rich regions compared to the default Minimap2 settings\n(\u201cMethods\u201d). Alignments shorter than 1kbp (default) are then discarded, and alignment coordinates are rounded to the nearest multiple of a rounding factor (default: 1 kbp for ROI \u2264 500 kbp, 10 kbp for\nROI > 500 kbp) to eliminate small alignment incongruencies.\n\n#### iii) Alignment segmentation\nA segmentation algorithm simplifies the alignment by identifying\nuninterrupted stretches of alignment, referred to as \u201csegments,\u201d which\nrange in size from 1 kbp to several hundred kbp (\u201cMethods\u201d, Fig. S3).\nThis segmented representation of the alignment retains all information of the alignment, while significantly simplifying the identification\nof NAHR-enabling repeat pairs and the exhaustive search for sSVs in\nthe subsequent step.\n\n#### iv) Exhaustive search for sSVs\nThe segmented alignment, represented as a matrix, serves as the\nfoundation for an exhaustive search for NAHR-based sSVs. This search\nemploys a breadth-first search approach to explore possible\n\n\n-----\n\ntrajectories of sSVs, with the goal of transforming the reference genome segments (ROI-Ref, represented on the x-axis) into the corresponding query genome structure (ROI-Query) (Fig. 1C). At each stage\nof the search, the algorithm:\n\n(1) generates a list of potential downstream NAHR-based SVs\n\n(deletions and duplications between pairs of segments in the same\norientation, and inversions between pairs in inverse orientation).\n\n(2) Simulates each SV by deleting, duplicating, or inverting\n\nrespective columns of the alignment matrix, generating new pairwise\nalignment matrices.\n\nFig. 1 | Overview: the NAHRwhals sSV detection method. A Schematic representation of a sequence pair illustrating the principle of serial SVs (sSVs). Traditional SV calling is often limited to detangling only simple SV (Del vs. Inv) or to\nreport the entire allele (Del-Inv-Del; middle). Instead, NAHRwhals infers a series of\nsimple SV which can explain a given structural haplotype outcome (Inv-Del; right).\nB Flowchart showing the key steps of the NAHRwhals algorithm. Starting from\nreference and alternative assemblies and a reference region of interest, the\nhomologous region is first extracted from the assembly. Pairwise alignments\nbetween Ref and Alt are generated and transformed into a segmented representation. Using this segmented dotplot, an exhaustive search is invoked to explore\n\n\n(3) Calculates a \u2018segmented alignment score\u2019 which quantifies the\n\npercentage of correctly aligned segments between ROI-Ref and ROIQuery, scaled by segment size (Methods).\n\nThe algorithm explores this space up to a predefined maximum\n\ndepth [default: 3], using a tree structure where each node represents a\nstate of the genomic locus after applying previous SVs. Then, sSVs with\na segmented alignment score within 5% of the best scoring one are\nreported. For downstream analyses, a simulation is considered \u2018successful\u2019 if it achieves an alignment score above a given threshold\n\n[default: 98%]. As default heuristics, we limit the maximum allowed\n\npossible series of NAHR-mediated rearrangements explaining the structural differences.

To assess the performance of NAHRwhals, we generated and surveyed 1,200 artificial sequences containing two pairs of segmental duplications each, and simulated sSVs of\ndepth one to three (e.g. Dup-Inv-Del) (\u201cMethods\u201d, Fig. S4). We additionally randomized the length (0.1 kbp\u221210 kbp) and similarity (90%\n\u221299%) of segmental duplications to estimate thresholds above which\npairwise alignment are typically reported and represented in the segmented dotplots. We find a positive correlation between genotyping\naccuracy and the length and similarity of repeats, with near-perfect\nsSV-detection accuracy if the repeat length exceeded 10 kbp in this\nsimulated setting, while short (100\u2019s bp) or highly dissimilar repeats\n(<90%) are typically rejected from sSV simulation (Fig. 1D). To further\nconfirm the viability of NAHRwhals in a more realistic setting, we\napplied NAHRwhals to ten previously identified inversion loci of\nvarying complexity and known to be subject to NAHR. In this\nbenchmarking exercise, NAHRwhals obtained accurate segmented\nrepresentations and expected SV genotypes for all ten loci (Fig. 1E, S5).\nWe next tested NAHRwhals in whole-genome mode on the hg38 vs T2T\nreference to replicate the set of validated SVs published in ref. 33\n(Fig. S3). Using all \u2018validated\u2019 SVs above 10kbp and a 25% reciprocal\noverlap criterion, out of 268 SVs >10kbp in the joint callset, 129 (48%)\nwere exclusive to Yang et al., 84 (31%) exclusive to NAHRwhals and 55\n(20%) jointly called. Among the 55 joint calls, genotypes differed in\neight cases, in six of which we find NAHRwhals to be either equally\n(N = 1) or more (N = 5) accurate (Fig. S6). Yang et al.\u2014exclusive calls\nwere 1.3-times less frequently overlapping segmental duplications,\nsuggesting that the SVs missed by NAHRwhals are enriched for nonNAHR events. Notably, all three largest SVs were deemed sSVs and\nwere exclusive to NAHRwhals, although two regions appeared in nonvalidated callsets and without correct genotype. To demonstrate that\nNAHRwhals works independently of species, we also analyzed the\nHeinz1706 vs M82 Tomato plant assemblies, identifying four deletions explicable by NAHR (Fig. S7). In conclusion, our method shows\npromising results across simulated and previously characterized\nNAHR-affected regions along the genome.\n\nAutomated reconstruction of sSVs across 336 loci along the\nhuman genome. Having established the general ability of NAHRwhals\nto infer sSVs through simulations and example test loci, we next performed a broad survey for sSV events in 28 individuals (yielding 56\nhaplotype-resolved assemblies). These assemblies were generated by\nthe Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) using\nPacific Biosciences long read sequencing. These include hitherto\nunpublished assemblies of 5 human genomes, amounting to 10\nassembled haplotypes, generated using 27.7\u201347.2X coverage Pacific\nBiosciences long reads (HiFi) that were phased into chromosome-scale\nhaplotypes using Strand-seq (Methods). Since these 56 assemblies\nspan human individuals of diverse population ancestry, they allow us\nto obtain an estimate for the prevalence of sSVs in humans and identify\nclasses of sSV-mediated variation. To this end, we defined a list of\npotentially sSV-carrying genomic regions by applying a merging\nstrategy in which we integrated: (a) all SV regions longer than 10 kbp\ndetermined in a previous comprehensive SV survey of 64 human\nhaplotypes (n = 915); (b) sites of polymorphic human inversions\n\nlonger than 10 kbp (n = 290); and (c) segmental duplications obtained\nthrough the UCSC Table Browser. Using this procedure, we determined 336 non-overlapping regions of interest (ROIs, median length:\n170.8 kbp), which were subsequently scanned for sSV content. In each\nof these regions, we tested the human along with four great-ape\nassembled haplotypes (Methods) for (s)SVs with respect to the CHM13T2T-v1.1 genome assembly. ROIs were provided in GRCh38\n\ncoordinates to NAHRwhals, which converted input coordinates to\nCHM13-T2T using a custom segment-liftover procedure based on\nminimap2 (Methods).\n\nBy screening across these samples and loci, NAHRwhals inferred\n\n37 loci with at least one instance of overlapping SVs likely to have\narisen in a serial manner (Supplementary Data 1). Adjacent (i.e. nonoverlapping) SVs werenot considered serial. Among the remaining 299\nregions, 8 regions did not display a contiguous assembly in any sample\nand 21 regions could not be explained by NAHRwhals (despite being\nassembled in at least one sample), indicative of the involvement of\nnon-NAHR mediated mechanisms. All other loci (270) displayed only\nzero-stage (Ref) or single-stage SVs (Inv, Del, Dup) (Fig. 2A, S8). The\ngroup of 37 sSVs was subsequently retained for further analysis\n(Fig. 2B, Supplementary Data 2). Across the 37 sSV regions in 56 human\nhaplotypes, we identified 163 SVs of predicted depth 2 or 3. SVs of\ndepth 2 and 3 were generally rare, displaying average allele frequencies\n2.3-fold and 4.8-fold lower than depth-1 SVs, respectively (Figs. S9,\nS10). Notably, 65% of all predicted intermediate states (e.g., \u2018Inv\u2019 for an\n\u2018Inv+Del\u2019 haplotype) were indeed observed in another sample (Fig. 2C),\nsuggesting that most of these complex NAHR loci are the result of\naccumulation of serial, temporally distinct events. Furthermore, all 20/\n20 sSVs for which the predicted intermediate state was missing were\nrare events (allele count <3), suggesting that their intermediate states\nmay be missing due to our limited sample size.\n\nReflective of the often complex nature of the loci, out of all 2109\n\nsequences (corresponding to 37 loci in 56 de novo assemblies plus\nhg38), assembly breaks prevented detailed analyses of potential sSVs\nin almost one third (625/2109 (29.6%)). As expected, the number of\ncontiguously assembled regions was correlated with assembly N50\n(Fig. S11). Likewise, the length and SD-content of regions were negatively correlated with the rate at which they could be resolved\n(Fig. S12). Samples with self-identified ancestries from AFR showed a\nslight but significant enrichment in depth-1 and depth-2 SVs compared\nto samples of admixed american (AMR) and east asian (EAS) ancestry,\nrespectively (Fig. S13). However, the low number of samples per\nsuperpopulation (AFR: 15, AMR: 3, EUR: 4, EAS: 5, SAS: 1) discouraged\nfurther ancestry-based analyses.\n\nLastly, 540/2109 sequences (25.6%) were considered as \u2018unex\nplained\u2019 as NAHRwhals did not indicate either a reference state or any\nNAHR events. We investigated these further by manually curating 35 of\nthese alignments - one for each sSV loci which had at least one unexplained sample (Fig. S14). The majority indeed displayed either smallscale (12/35; 34.3%) or large-scale (7/35; 20%) non-NAHR rearrangements. Further 10 regions (28.6%) exceeded the borders of our window\nor no homologous alignment was found. In six cases (17.1%), NAHRwhals was too conservative in rejecting alignments for exceeding\nboundaries (n = 4) or missed an optimal solution due to prematurely\naborting branches of the mutation search tree (n = 2).\n\nTo better visualize and report the sSVs results across multiple\n\nsamples, we devised a visualization resembling a directed flowchart, in\nwhich each temporally distinctNAHR mutation event is represented by\na node (Fig. 2D, F). To illustrate the types of sSVs identified with\nNAHRwhals, we first highlight a ~ 1.5 Mbp region on chromosomal\nregion 1p11.2-1p12, which displays several pairs of overlapping SDs in\nthe reference state (carried by CHM13-T2T, hg38 and four other\nassemblies). A simple inversion between one of the SD pairs was\nobserved in 17 samples, and finally 15 samples were carrying a third\nconfiguration which presumably features deletion of the inverted\nhaplotype, corresponding to an \u2018Inv + Del\u2019 sSV (Fig. 2D, E). Another\nexample of a more complex sSV-rich region was found in chromosomal region 11p15.4. In this case, several distinct haplotype configurations were observed, which could be explained by one, two and three\nconsecutive SVs, respectively (Fig. 2F, G). Our callset includes also\nother regions for which sSV-like patterns have been described previously, such as variation in regions containing TCAF1/TCAF2 (7q35\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 2 | Inversion regions identified as sSVs.

G Dotplot and SD schematics of a highly\nrearranged (left) and a reference-like (right) alternative configuration. H sSVs found\nin the disease-relevant TPSAB1-containing region. Observed CNVs can be explained\nas simple SVs on the CHM13-T2T-like configuration, but appear as sSVs with respect\nto hg38 (Fig. S25).\n\ndotplot visualization for each of the 37 sSVs are in the supplementary\nmaterial (Figs. S15\u2013S22).\n\nIn order to validate the inversion status of sSVs, we made use of an\n\northogonal sequencing technology, template strand sequencing\n\n\n-----\n\n(Strand-Seq), with data available for 19/28 samples. 11/37 regions\nexhibited sufficient unique sequence content to be examined with the\ntechnology. Diploid inversion genotypes between Strand-Seq and\nNAHRwhals agree in 95/104 SVs (91%, Supplementary Data 1). Apart\nfrom inversions, Strand-Seq was able to resolve depth-2 CNVs in two\nloci, confirming all predicted SVs in these regions (Fig. S23, S24,\n\u201cMethods\u201d). We also compared our callset to rearrangements published by the HPRC, noting that 17/37 locations are exclusive to\nNAHRwhals and may have been missed in the HPRC dataset (10%\nreciprocal overlap). The sequences of the 37 sSV loci were additionally\nvalidated by mapping ultra-long nanopore reads (generated by the\nHGSVC, and available for 11/26 samples) directly to the respective\nassemblies and searching for homozygous variants using Sniffles2.\nAlignment misassemblies should not be supported by any ONT reads,\nand thus appear as homozygous SVs (\u201cMethods\u201d). 45/796 sequences\n(5.7%) display homozygous indels above 10kbp which may point at\ncollapsed or duplicated regions. Among screened haplotype configurations which were predicted by NAHRwhals only once, the ratio of\nindel-containing sequences was only marginally higher (2/19 sequences (10.5%)), suggesting that most reported calls are biologically\nmeaningful.\n\nWe also re-analysed all 119 \u2018simple SV\u2019 calls, this time using hg38 as\n\na reference to account for the possibility that certain loci may appear\nas sSVs only in the context of a different reference allele. This analysis\nyielded four additional hg38-specific sSVs (Supplementary Data 1),\nthree of which displayed \u2018Dup-Dup\u2019 alleles indicative of a shorter (or\ncollapsed) allele represented in hg38. In the last identified region, a 49\nkbp region on 16p13.3, hg38 represents a minor inverted allele which is\npredicted to undergo \u2018Inv-Del\u2019 (n = 2) and \u2018Inv-Dup\u2019 (n = 1) in three\nsamples, while the same alleles appear as simple SVs when compared\nto CHM13-T2T (Fig. 2H). Notably, the region contains the TPSAB1/\nTPSAB2 genes (Fig. S25), CNVs of which have been associated with\nAlpha Tryptasemia, a non-lethal hereditary disease affecting up to 4-6%\nof the population. To our knowledge, the mechanistic background of\ntheseCNVs has not been clarified previously. Lastly, we note that, when\nmapped back to hg38, 7/37 (18.9%) sSV loci display long (>1 kbp)\nstretches of hard-masked bases, which prohibit faithful SV reconstruction, highlighting the importance of using a contiguous reference\nfor studying sSV loci. Therefore, our screening reveals a high prevalence of repeat-rich regions for sSV formation and further indicates\nthat complex variation in many dynamic human loci can be explained\nin the framework of sSVs.\n\nPopulation-based validation of the \u2018serial\u2019 nature of SVs. We next\nexplored the genetic relationship of sSV carrying haplotypes to test\nwhether sSVs have formed in a multi-step process rather than through\n\u2018one-time\u2019 complex rearrangements. We hypothesized that, should the\nsSV hypothesis be true, haplotypes of higher sSV depth should be\ngenetically more similar to their intermediate predecessor state rather\nthan reference (i.e., \u2018inv-del\u2019 haplotypes should locally be more similar\nto \u2018inv\u2019 than to \u2018ref\u2019 haplotypes). To test this, we combined NAHRwhalsbased genotypes with an external high-quality 1000 Genomes SNP\ncallset. A workflow based on WhatsHap was used to synchronize\nhaplotype assignments (h1/h2) in the two callsets (Methods).\n\nIn line with our expectations, we found a case of two \u2018dup-dup\u2019\n\ncarriers co-clustering with their putative \u2018dup\u2019 predecessor (Fig. S26)\nand a more complex case of a depth-three SV, in which carriers of ref or\ndepth-1 SV co-cluster, while deeper SV states, \u2018dup+inv\u2019 and \u2018dup+inv\n+inv\u2019 form a separate haplotype cluster (Fig. S27). In the remaining\ncases, clustering patterns are less clear, with carriers of SVs of different\n\u2018depths\u2019 often highly intermixed and thus pointing towards multiple,\nseparately emerging instances of the mutations (Figs. S28, S29). Such\ncomplex patterns, previously described in more detail e.g. for the\nTCAF locus, suggest that reconstruction of the ancestry of loci\nrequires more in-depth analyses. The non-trivial inheritance patterns\n\n\nare reminiscent of recurrent inversions, which are strongly enriched\nin sSV regions and which may explain part of to the complexity.\n\nsSV occurrence and SV complexity across Hominidae. Having\nidentified abundant sSV loci in humans, we next set out to examine to\nwhich degree sSVs in these regions are human-specific, as a prerequisite to gaining an understanding as to how these regions may\nhave emerged evolutionarily. Repeat-associated variation is known to\nhave contributed substantially to the evolution of modern humans,\nand hundreds of genomic regions display SD-mediated inversions\nbetween non-human primates and humans[\u2013], frequently accompanied by secondary CNVs near their breakpoints. We considered\nthat a fraction of our human sSV loci, too, may have undergone substantial restructuring during great ape evolution, which may be\nexplicable through sSVs. To test this, we turned our attention to sSVs in\nthe four great ape genome assemblies included in our dataset\n(Methods). To account for the overall higher sequence divergence, we\nchose a lower threshold parameter of 95% for considering sequence\nreconstruction successful. When reviewing the set of 37 CHM13-T2Tbased human sSV loci, we find that in 16/37 loci (43.2%), NAHRwhals\ncould determine rearrangements translating from the human locus\nconfiguration to that of at least one great ape variant (Fig. 3A).\n\nOut of 37 loci, only four suffered from a lack of locus-spanning\n\ncontigs in any of the ape assemblies, suggesting that the high ratio of\nunexplained variants (21/37 regions) does not stem primarily from a\nlack of assembled sequence quality, but may instead be attributed to\nnon-NAHR-associated SVs or missed calls by NAHRwhals. To decide\nwhich of these is the case, we examined dotplot visualizations of these\nregions (Figs. S30\u2013S32). Indeed, the unexplained loci consistently\ndisplayed advanced levels of rearrangements, frequently featuring\nlarge insertions, deletions and translocations, unattributable to NAHR,\nwhich are likely the result of other formation mechanisms, including\nduplicative transposition events not modeled by our framework. We\nillustrate the scope of complexity of sSV loci in great apes along a 12\nMbp region on the p-arm of chr16 (Fig. 3B), which harbors two human\nsSV loci, neither of which could be explained in any greatape assembly.\nA dotplot visualization of these regions in the two contiguous ape\nassemblies (Bonobo and Orangutan) reveals that both sSV loci are part\nof larger, highly complex rearrangements that exceed the scale of the\nhuman sSV both in size and complexity.\n\nIn line with greater evolutionary distances involved, we notice an\n\napproximately twofold enriched fraction of 2- and 3-step vs 1- step SVs\nin apes compared to humans (simpleSVs/multi-stepSVs/fraction:\nhumans: 302/163/1.85, apes: 11/12/0.92). We again highlight two\nexamples of sSV loci here. First, the aforementioned TCAF1/2-containing region on 7q35 displays a set of overlapping SDs in the CHM13T2T-configuration, which can transition into an \u201cInv+Del\u201d state in\nBonobo and Chimpanzee (Fig. 3C). The further distant species Gorilla\nand Orangutan display a somewhat analogous configuration, but also\nharbor additional insertions that cannot be explained by NAHR alone.\nWe also find instances of more isolated non-NAHR events, such as a\nduplicated section on Xq28 containing cancer/testis antigen 1\n(CTAG1A/CTAG1B) genes, which are implicated with a variety of\ncancers. In our dataset, the CHM13-T2T assembly, Bonobo and\nChimpanzee share the same locus configuration, which is distinct from\nthe non-duplicated region in Orangutan. NAHR was again not sufficient\nto explain the implicated duplication event. Across these examples\nand the remaining dataset, our results suggest that in the majority of\nhuman sSV loci, NAHR alone is insufficient to explain inter-species\nvariation, where consequently also other DNA rearrangement\n\nmechanisms such as MMBIR/FoSTes or duplicative transposition[,]\n\nare likely at play.\n\nsSV regions co-locate with disease-causing CNVs, core duplicon\ngenes and recurrent inversions. NAHR-mediated recurrent\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 3 | Human sSV loci in great ape genome assemblies. A Tabular view of\nNAHRwhals-based SV genotypes across 37 human sSV sites in four ape species. In 16\nloci, the observed variation could be explained for at least one ape haplotype.\nB Dotplot views of a ca. 12 Mbp region on 16p, comparing the assemblies of CHM13T2T, Bonobo and Orangutan (all single-contig; Chimpanzee and Gorilla: no\n\ninversions co-cluster with disease-causing CNVs in some of the most\ndynamically evolving regions of the human genome. To anticipate\nwhether our sSVs may be able to explain some of the variation in these\nregions, we initially tested sSV regions for spatial co-location with\nrecurrent inversions and disease-associated CNVs (morbid CNVs)\n(Supplementary Data 3). In line with the tendency of (NAHR-promoting) SDs to flank morbid CNV sites[\u2013], 16/37 sSVs (43.2%) overlapped\nwith a morbid CNV region or its close surrounding (plus/minus 25% of\nthe CNV length), compared to 51/299 (17.1%) of non-sSV loci, corresponding to a 3.7-fold enrichment of sSVs among morbid CNVoverlapping loci (p = 4.9 \u00d7 10[\u2013], one-sided Fisher\u2019s Exact Test). To\naccount for the possibility that this effect may be driven by locus size\n(i.e., larger loci may be more likely to exhibit sSVs while also being\nmore likely to overlap morbid CNVs), we repeated the experiment, this\ntime measuring if the midpoint of a locus falls into a morbid CNV. This\ndid not alter the overall trend, with 15/37 midpoints of sSV-midpoints\nand 47/299 non-sSV-midpoints overlapping morbid CNV, respectively\n(odds ratio 3.63, p = 7.1 \u00d7 10[-4], one-sided Fisher\u2019s Exact Test). Furthermore, 11/37 (29.7%) of sSV loci overlapped at least one member of a\ngene family mapping to core duplicons such as GOLGA and NPIP\n\n\ncontiguous asm). Two human sSV loci are highlighted in green. C Variation\nobserved in the TCAF1/2 containing region on 7q35. Gorilla and Orangutan likely\ndisplay a mixture of NAHR and non-NAHR SVs. D View of the CTAG1A/CTAG1B\ncontaining locus. Compared to Orangutan the CHM13-T2T-, Bonobo and Chimpanzee sequences harbor a duplication, which cannot be explained by NAHR.\n\n(\u201cMethods\u201d, Supplementary Data 3), corresponding to a 6.6-fold\nenrichment compared to non-sSV loci where this was the case for 18/\n299 (6.0%) regions (p = 5.6 \u00d7 10[\u2013], one-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test). This\nenrichment is in line with the role of core duplicons which are implicated in the expansion of segmental duplication and further repeatdriven mutational processes. Lastly, sSVs were 6.25-fold more likely\nto overlap with recurrent inversions than non-sSV loci (12/37 (32.4%) vs\n21/299 (7.0%) overlaps; p = 3.78 \u00d7 10[\u2013], one-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test),\nsupporting the notion that recurrent inversions are disproportionately\nassociated with complex variation. When again only sSV-midpoints\nwere considered, the enrichment dropped to 3.66-fold (6/37 vs 15/299\noverlaps, p = 0.019, one-sided Fisher\u2019s Exact Test). Consequently, our\nscreening suggests that, among the 336 initially included loci, sSVs are\nstrongly (3.66 to 6.6-fold) enriched in regions containing recurrent\ninversions, morbid CNVs and expanding SDs.\n\nDespite our sample set consisting of phenotypically healthy\n\nindividuals unlikely to carry morbid CNVs, we hypothesized that the\nsSVs focused on in this study may still follow similar mutational patterns as their morbid counterparts, and may help in uncovering\nmutational \u2018paths\u2019 leading to disease. We thus proceeded to explore\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 4 | sSVs in disease-relevant regions. A Dotplot view of the 22q11 Dup/Del\nregion, with two SD-rich blocks of sSV activity highlighted above. B Nested SVs lead\nto duplication or deletion of segmental duplications bordering the 22q11 Dup/Del\nregion; potentially affecting the risk of subsequent CNV formation. C Inversion of\none breakpoint of the SOTOS deletion creates a long pair of directly oriented SVs\nlikely predisposing to subsequent CNV formation. D Two sSVs map to two ends of\n\nthe molecular underpinnings of the co-location of inversions, morbid\nCNVs and sSV loci in our data. Indeed, by taking into account a larger\nwindow around morbid CNV co-locating sSVs, we found several\ninstances of variants which we would consider likely \u2018premutative\u2019\nunder the sSV hypothesis. The first case discovered this way lies in\nchromosomal region 22q11, which can harbor local duplications and\ndeletions (the latter being associated to DiGeorge Syndrome). The\nregion contains a network of segmental duplications which are highly\nvariable across humans and thought to represent mediators of the\n22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Fig. 4A). One sSV locus maps to a 1,200\nkbp block of SDs flanking the region. The sSV features two pairs of\noverlapping pairs of inversely oriented SDs, out of which three divergent haplotypes emerge (Fig. 4B), two of which lead to expansion or\ncontraction of the SD content, possibly increasing or decreasing the\nrisk for subsequent formation of the larger disease-causing CNV. Our\nvalidation of this region with ONT reads (Methods) was not entirely\nconclusive, suggesting that further variants may be present in this\nregion (Fig. S33A). However, the presence of three instances of the\npredicted intermediate (inverted) state in other samples (Fig. 4B) does\nsupport the emergence of \u2018Inv-Del\u2019 and \u2018Inv-Dup\u2019 haplotypes.\n\n\nthe 15q25.2 deletion region, making both breakpoints susceptible to individual\nrearrangements. An inversion in one sample leads to transfer of SD sequence to a\nthird sSV block. E Variation observed in the highly recurrent 8p23.1 Inv/Del/Dup\nregion. Among the three resolved instances of this locus, NAHR-based variation was\nobserved in both flanking SD blocks.\n\nPrimed by this initial example, we set up a more systematic\n\nscreening to identify sSV events co-locating with morbid CNVs. To this\nend, we investigated a set of 113 disease-associated CNV locations[,],\nwhich we again subjected to a merging procedure to unify redundant\ncalls and include surrounding SDs (Methods), leading to 48 nonredundant morbid CNV locations of interest which were tested with\nNAHRwhals across all 56 haplotype assemblies (Supplementary\nData 4). Using this procedure, 35/48 loci displayed only reference\nstates, non-contiguous assemblies or unexplained variance. Nine loci\ndisplayed single SVs, and another four displayed sSVs of depth 2\n(Fig. S34, Supplementary Data 4). Focussing initially on SVs of depth 1,\nwe report an inversion that can, under the sSV hypothesis, be interpreted as potentially premutative for formation of a ~ 2 Mbp CNV\nfound in patients with the SOTOS syndrome. Repeats at the flanks of\nthis region have been noted before as substrates for NAHR[,]. Our\ninspection reveals a novel 258 kbp inversion of parts of the distal\nsegmental duplication, present in 1/40 resolved haplotypes (2.5%)\n(Fig. 4C) and confirmed by orthogonal ONT-based validation. This\ninversion flips a substantial SD-containing segment (denoted as DLCRA in previous literature) into direct orientation with its proximal\n\n\n-----\n\ncounterpart, leading us to hypothesize that the inverted configuration\ncould be at risk for subsequent morbid CNV formation.\n\nTurning our attention to the four loci displaying sSV activity\n\n(regions 16p12.2-16p11.2 (12.4 Mbp), 15q25.3-15q25.2 (3.7 Mbp), 8p23.18p22 (6.9 Mbp), 3q29 (2.6 Mbp); Supplementary Data 4), we identified\nfurther regions in which the concept of sSVs yields hypotheses of CNV\nformation events. Since we described variation in the 3q29 region\nbefore, we here did not further focus on this region. In the case of\n15q25.3-15q25.2, we observed a ~ 700 kbp inversion which contains\nfurther SD fragments and effectively acts as a transporter of those SDs\nbetween two SD blocks (red circles, Fig. 4D). We also observed sSV\nactivity in the 8p23.1 Inv/Del/Dup region in three resolved samples.\nVariation in this case is found in both flanking SD blocks (Del-Del) as\nwell as between the blocks (Inv-Del) (Fig. 4E). All assembly configurations described here could be validated with ONT reads (Fig. S-33B-D).\nExtrapolating from these examples, we propose a hierarchical model\nof sSVs, in which individual \u2018blocks\u2019 display variations within themselves, but, additionally, sequence is prone to be exchanged between\nblocks with inversions as the transport media. While Strand-Seq data\nwere unavailable in the sample carrying the 15q25 inversion, we\northogonally validated the SVs shown in SOTOS syndrome and 8p23.1,\nas well as providing further support for 22q11 (Fig. S35).\n\n## Discussion\nWe present NAHRwhals, a long-read assembly-based workflow for\nidentifying and deconvoluting regions of overlapping NAHR-mediated\nrearrangements. NAHRwhals works by determining local alignments of\na region of interest to a reference, and subsequent segmentation of the\nalignment to summarize syntenic blocks via \u2018compressed dotplots\u2019.\nThis massive reduction in data complexity allows us to apply an\nexhaustive search strategy in which we effectively test all possible\nsequences of NAHR events up to depth 3 (or higher; at the cost of\ncomputation time). Thus, our method closes an important gap in\ncurrent methodology: to enable the automatic detection and study of\ngenome complexity caused by overlapping and consecutive repeatmediated rearrangements. NAHRwhals can be applied to different\nmammalian species, as highlighted through great ape and tomato\nbased analyses, enabling to further the understanding of the impact of\ncomplex rearrangement processes during genome evolution. SVs\nassociated with segmental duplications are not yet routinely detected\nby most SV callers, and, likewise, genomic rearrangements with multiple breakpoints are still difficult to spot algorithmically. With\nNAHRwhals, we actively embrace SDs and multiple breakpoints, and\ndemonstrate that the respective complex rearrangements under study\nfollow rules that can be modeled. NAHRwhals and its sSV hypothesis\ncan thus lead to new SV discoveries (e.g. three Mbp-sized SVs in T2T)\nand insights into these complex regions that might have implications\nin disease or other phenotypes as well as evolution.\n\nOur representation of alignments in \u2018segmented\u2019 dotplots bears\n\nparallels to genome assembly or pan genome graphs, with NAHRwhals\nsegments being analogous to nodes in a graph[,]. Following this\nanalogy, the relative position of a NAHRwhals segments could be reinterpreted as links between nodes, with e.g. diagonally adjacent segments being considered \u2018linked\u2019. In this representation, we reason that\nNAHRwhals SV calling could eventually be re-formulated as a graph\ntraversal problem, which we consider a promising alternative to the\ncurrently employed brute-force algorithm.\n\nWe showcase the advances made by NAHRwhals by screening\n\nacross 23 previously published and 5 previously unpublished\nhaplotype-resolved human genomic assemblies, revealing NAHRmediated complexities in 37 loci and suggesting that these patterns\nare far more common in healthy individuals than current genomic\nstudies have suggested. Among all inferred sSV configurations,\nroughly two-thirds of predicted intermediate states could indeed be\nobserved in other samples, supporting the notion that the majority of\n\n\nsuch complexities have formed via serial accumulation of overlapping\nsimple SVs, rather than by individual complex events.\n\nAs a currently remaining limitation, it should be noted that\n\nNAHRwhals does not incorporate information about population-based\nhaplotype structures in its analysis. Indeed, population-based analysis\nof the sSV loci revealed highly complex inheritance patterns likely to\nbe mediated by high rates of SV recurrence such as inversion toggling.\nAs a result, actual locus histories could be more complex than what is\npredicted by the tool unless in the case of closely related individuals\ncommonly found e.g. in patient trios. In evolutionary studies, we\nrecommend validating the predicted sSVs using complementary\nmethods to gain a more complete understanding of the locus history.\nMoreover, individual non-NAHR based complex rearrangement events\ncan lead to highly complex patterns of variation, too, and these may\nin some instances be hard to distinguish from sSVs, especially in cases\nwhere intermediate haplotype structures are missing. The \u2018missing\u2019\nintermediates were, without exception, associated with sSVs of allele\ncount below three, suggesting that they may be missing from our\ncallset due to the low sample number. Yet, the presence of flanking\nsegmental duplications at the boundaries of the SV events studied here\nsupport a major role of NAHR even in these cases.\n\nWhen extending our search to greater evolutionary distances, we\n\nnote that NAHR alone is rarely sufficient to explain variation in sSV loci\nacross four great ape assemblies. Assembly gaps did not contribute\nsignificantly to these unexplained variants, supporting the notion that\nover evolutionary timespans (mya), human sSV loci have seen largescale rearrangement processes mediated by mechanisms distinct from\nNAHR. We note that in the future, greater numbers of high-quality ape\nassemblies will help paint a finer picture, especially concerning the\nphenomena of incomplete lineage sorting and recurrence.\n\nHuman NAHR-mediated complexities are strongly (3 to 6-fold)\n\nenriched in regions containing recurrent inversions and disease associated CNVs and can explain variation in medically relevant genes such\nas TPSAB1. sSVs in particular show a dynamic interplay with sequences\nknown to be at risk for CNVs. Such interactions are not unexpected\ngiven that morbid CNV regions are frequently flanked by, and nested\nin, complex repeat patterns which mediate their formation[,][,][,]. We\nidentify at least two modes of interaction. Firstly, the individual flanks\nof such regions are prone to harboring sSVs, altering the SD content\navailable for formation of the \u2018main\u2019 CNV. In other cases, we also\nobserve \u2018hierarchical\u2019 events in which large inversions span regions of\nCNV risk and contribute to exchanging sequence between the flanks,\nputatively increasing their complexity over time, or creating new\nhotspots of interspersed SDs which can again diversify over time.\n\nThe choice of the reference sequence is important as alleles might\n\nchange. We showcased this by comparing GRCh38 and CHM13-T2T,\nwhere the former suffered from unresolved sequences. These two\nreferences frequently represented alternative versions of alleles, some\nof which are likely attributable to falsely collapsed or duplicated\nsequences in GRCh38, whereas in other cases they may be attributable to repeated mutation and high variability. As highlighted, the\ndynamic nature of these sequences is especially important as many\nsegmental duplications have an impact on medically relevant genes or\nother important phenotypes and thus motivate a close analysis also\nin other organisms. To accomplish this, NAHRwhals can be adjusted to\nsearches across species or even outside of hominidae. Due to the\ndefault resolution of 1 kbp for segment compression, repeats shorter\nthan 1 kbp are likely to be missed by our algorithm and are thus not\nmodeled as substrates for NAHR. Notable candidate for short SVmediating repeats are e.g. pairs of Alu-elements, although their mode\nof formation likely involves mechanisms other than NAHR, and they\nmediate predominantly short SVs of few 100 bps to <5 kbp. Thus,\nwhile sSV-like mechanisms might be observable also at such smaller\nscales, due to their size we do not expect such SVs to play a major role\nin the predisposition of the sSVs described here.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe maximum depth (default: 3) during the breadth-first\n\nexhaustive search for mutations can in principle also be a limiting\nfactor in finding correct solutions. Although we have not encountered\nloci exhibiting depth-four SVs, we have left the option for higher depth\nexploration open to the user, and also exposed heuristics to control\nthe otherwise exponential growth of nodes to explore at higher\ndepths. However, four or more consecutive SVs would also indicate\nthat a locus has undergone such extreme levels of restructuring that\ntheseSVs likely require more detailed analysis, and wetherefore do not\nconsider the depth a highly limiting factor.\n\nA natural future extension of NAHRwhals would be also to take\n\ninto account the percentual identity of segments to improve alignment\nscoring, rather than considering all segments as \u2018perfect\u2019 alignments.\nWe expect that this approach would help selecting the correct optimal\nsolution at the end of the exhaustive mutation search. At the same\ntime, however, even such an approach will suffer from the often prohibitively complex variation patterns in SDs owing to inversion\nrecurrence, sequential cycles of duplication and deletion, and frequent\ngene conversion events[,].\n\nFor obvious reasons, NAHRwhals is also reliant on the correctness\n\nof the assembly itself. For this study, we have assessed the correctness\nof most assemblies by realigning ultra long ONT reads to themselves\nand screening for homozygous SV across them. Such SV would indicate assembly errors such as rearrangements that would impact the\nresults of NAHRwhals. Over the screened assemblies, no misarragements were observed, and indels indicative of collapses or\nduplications were rare, too (~5% of sequences) (Fig. S33).\n\nAnother important point to accomplish is the automatic para\nmeter tuning that is happening in NAHRwhals. Firstly, we observe a\ngeneral robustness of the dotplot encryption. Still, our level of\ncompression scales with overall sequence length, meaning that SV\npredictions can be sensitive to the size of the region of interest \u2013 i.e.,\nSVs that affect only a small portion of the window (<10%) can be\nmissed in some cases. Furthermore, by default we consider sequence\nvariation as \u2018explained\u2019 if mutated alignments show more than 98%\ncongruence, again discarding variants much smaller than the\nsequence window. It is likely that a portion of sSVs adjacent to very\nlong CNV sites may have been missed by our survey in this way. Thus,\nlocal rearrangements may appear to be unexplained from a narrow\nangle, but may be explained when the broader sequence context is\ntaken into account.\n\nOverall, this work demonstrates the significance of complex\n\nNAHR-shaped variation and its ubiquitous detection across newly\nassembled genomes, regardless of species. These regions have been\ndemonstrated to be of critical importance in various phenotypes,\nincluding those related to disease. NAHRwhals allows for the automatic detection and study of these regions across multiple assemblies, as well as the identification of the events that likely lead to the\ncomplex patterns that are currently observed. With the rapidly\nincreasing number and quality of novel genome assemblies, we\nanticipate that NAHRwhals will be instrumental in uncovering the\norigins of disease-causing variants in patients and advancing our\nunderstanding of the evolution of these highly variable regions of the\ngenome.\n\n## Methods\n#### Pairwise sequence alignments\nTo obtain accurate pairwise alignments even in highly repetitive\ngenomic regions, a custom pipeline was built around the minimap2\naligner (version 2.18) to create pairwise alignments: Before aligning,\nthe Query sequence is split into chunks of 1 kbp by default. The \u2018chunks\u2019\nare then aligned to the Ref sequence separately (using the minimap2\nparameters -x asm20 -P -c -s 0 -M 0.2; see Fig. S2), reducing the need for\nread-splitting, which is known to be error-prone in minimap2. The\nchoice of chunklength represents a tradeoff, as (a) too small chunks\n\n\ntend to produce overly fragmented alignments which lead to long\ncomputation time and a tendency for shorter alignments, and (b)\noverly large chunks tend to ignore or over-merge short alignments. In\npractice, alignments have proved relatively robust towards the choice\nof chunklength (Figs. S36, S37), justifying our default choice. In a postprocessing step, alignment pairs are concatenated whenever the\nendpoint of one alignment falls in close proximity to the startpoint of\nanother (base pair distance cutoff: 5% of the chunk length). If multiple\nalignments \u2018compete\u2019 for the same partner (e.g., two alignments ending close to the beginning of another), only the longest \u2018competitor\u2019\nalignment gets selected for merging.\n\n#### Noise-reduction in pairwise alignments for subsequent segmentation\nPairwise alignments are retrieved from minimap2 in .paf format, in\nwhich each alignment can be interpreted as a four-dimensional vector\nfrom start (query-start/target-start) to end (query-end/target-end)\ncoordinates. To prepare subsequent compression steps, alignments\nare pre-processed in multiple ways: First, alignments are filtered by a\nminimum length threshold (l), removing very short alignments. Second, alignment breakpoint coordinates are rounded in x and y direction to the closest multiple of a rounding parameter (r). Finally,\nalignment vectors are shortened along the x or y axis in case they do\nnot have a slope of exactly 1 or -1 until they do so. The choice of r and l\ndirectly influence the expected dimensionality and complexity of the\nsegmented dotplot. To maximize information content while limiting\nthe size of segmented dotplots, we set l and r to be stepwise functions\nof the sequence length:\n\n(1) l = r = 100 for sequences smaller than 50 kbp\n\n(2) l = r = 1.000 for sequences between 50 kbp and 500 kbp\n\n(3) l = r = 10.000 for sequences between 500 kbp and 5 Mbp\n\n(4) l = r = 20.000 for sequences larger or equal to 5 Mbp\n\n#### Alignment segmentation and dotplot condensation\nA custom algorithm converts the pairwise alignment returned by\nminimap2 into a segmented representation (NAHRwhals step 3) which\nfacilitates downstream analysis and implicitly identifies repeat pairs\nrequired for subsequent steps. Following noise-reduction, borders, or\n\u2018gridlines\u2019, separating unique sequence blocks, are inferred in an\niterative way (Fig. S3). In the first iteration, horizontal and vertical\ngridlines are drawn starting from each start- or endpoint of any\nalignment. In every subsequent step, overlaps between existing gridlines and alignments are determined, with the points of overlaps serving as a new source for spawning a new gridline in perpendicular\ndirection. This process is repeated until no new gridlines can be\nspawned. In rare cases where the determined grid exceeds predefined\nmaximum dimensions (default: n_rows + n_cols <= 250; n_alignments\n<= 150), the parameters for minimum alignment length (l) and\nrounding (r) are doubled until dimension requirements are met. Any\nsequence interval between two gridlines is then considered a segment,\nand any pairwise alignment can be expressed as a matrix of alignment\nof segments (x: Ref, y: Query) (Fig. S3B).\n\n#### Exhaustive search for sSVs\nThe information reduction obtained from condensing potentially\nmulti-Mb alignments to a segmented matrix of much smaller dimensions allows us to employ an exhaustive search strategy to identify\nserial SVs capable of transforming the Ref-configuration into that of\nQuery. We focus on exploring NAHR-mediated SVs (deletions, duplications and inversions), and a key observation is that segmented\ndotplots retain information of repetitive sequences (i.e. rows or columns with >1 colored square). Starting from one segmented dotplot, a\nrecursive breadth-first algorithm initially identifies repeat pairs in Ref\n(pairs of colored squares in the same row) and infers possible NAHRmediated SVs (Del/Dup between similarly colored squares; Inv\n\n\n-----\n\nbetween opposites). Subsequently, every SV is being simulated by\ndeleting, duplicating or inverting respective columns of the segmented dotplot, and new higher-depth SVs are inferred and simulated\nas the search progresses. After each simulated mutation, the similarity\nbetween Query and the mutated Ref is determined (see \u201cMethods\u201d\nsection \u201cScoring of mutated segmented matrices\u201d). We implemented the\nfollowing heuristics (i) Limit the maximum allowed number of duplications of any segment to avoid \u2018exploding\u2019 sequence length [default:\n2]. If any mutated matrix has reached the maximum number of\nduplications, it will not be further duplicated. (ii) Per layer, retain only\nthe X best-scoring nodes [default: all nodes]. (iii) Limit the maximum\ndepth of the search [default: 3]. Finally, we report all optimal (score = 1)\nSV trajectories, as well as suboptimal SV trajectories within 5% of the\nscore of the best trajectory.\n\n#### Scoring of mutated segmented matrices\nMutated matrices are assigned a percent alignment score using a\nlinear-time heuristic greedy alignment. Positively aligning segments\nare treated as \u2018matches\u2019, everything else is treated as a mismatch.\nStarting at the first position of the query sequence, we identify the\nclosest match in the reference and assign it a score according to the\nfollowing recurrence, where i runs over min(query_positions, reference_positions) and j runs over positions in the reference:\n\nscore[i] = max j. (if is_match(i, j) then 1 / (1 + |offset[i]\n+ 1 - j | ) else 0)\noffset = 0\noffset[i + 1] = if not (exists j. is_match(i, j))\n\nthen offset[i] + 1\nelse argmin j. (if is_match(i, j) then |off\nset_i + 1 - j| else \u221e)\n\nfinal_score = (sum i. score[i]) / (reference_length +\nquery_length - offset[end])\n\nIf we restrict the maximum gap size to consider |offset_i + 1-j |, this\n\nrecurrence runs in linear time. Additionally, the score equals 1 only for a\nperfect alignment and decreases with the number of gaps and mismatches, making it a useful heuristic for our SV trajectory search.\n\n#### Whole-genome mode\nNAHRwhals can also be run in whole-genome mode, which automates\nthe identification of Regions of Interest (ROIs), i.e. potentially SVcarrying regions, to be scanned subsequently. Conceptually, ROIs are\nderived from alignment breaks in a whole-genome alignment of Ref\nand Query. In detail, given two assembly fasta files, Ref (e.g., hg38) and\nQuery (e.g., a single-haplotype de novo assembly), we\n\n1) run a whole-genome alignment with minimap preset \u2018-x asm5\u2019.\n2) Remove alignments which are entirely contained within other\n\nalignments in Ref and Query coordinates.\n\n3) Extract Ref and Query coordinates of all alignment breakpoints.\n4) Exclude pairs of breakpoints closer than 10kbp in Ref and Query\n\ncoordinates, which are typically indicative of smaller insertions and\ndeletions.\n\n5) Merge breakpoints to create windows of interest. We repeat\n\nthis process with three different merge distances; 200 kbp, 1 Mbp, 5\nMbp to account for differently sized SVs, creating partially overlapping\nwindows.\n\n6) Expand each window by 50% in each direction.\n7) Remove windows <50kbp after expansion; the resulting list are\n\nthe ROIs.\n\n8) Invoke NAHRwhals SV calling on each window.\n9) Post-processing: Should an SV call between two partially\n\noverlapping windows be discordant, keep the call made by the smallest\n(\u2018most zoomed-in\u2019) window.\n\n\n#### Simulation experiments\nFor each pair of \u201cSD similarity\u201d (90%, 95%, 99%) and \u201cSD length\u201d\n(100 bp, 500 bp, 1.000 bp, 10.000 bp), we created 50 genomic\nsequences with 2 pairs of non-overlapping SDs of randomized\nposition and orientation each. Subsequently, we simulated a pool of\nsequence derivatives, realizing two randomly chosen NAHR\nconcordant combinations of Inv, Del and Dup up to depth 3 each,\ntotaling 1200 mutated sequences (see Data availability). These mutated sequences and their unmutated \u2018ancestor\u2019 were given to NAHRwhals for SV calling and results were compared with the known\nbackground of sequences.\n\n#### Collection of 336 sSV-regions of interest\nIn order to maximize the scope of our survey, we based our sSV search\non a set of all (n = 107,590) SV regions from a previous large-scale SV\nsurvey of 64 human haplotypes, and additionally considered polymorphic inversion calls (n = 399), many of which are known to be\nassociated with complex variation. Given that individual SV calls may\nsometimes be part of the same sSV block, we devised a specialized\nstrategy to merge individual, spatially nearby SVs into broader\n\u2018SV;Repeat-containing\u2019 regions using the following procedure: (1) filter\nvariants to length >10 kbp to exclude the bulk of non-NAHR events. (2)\nmerge SVs with any overlapping segmental duplications (to include\nmutation-mediating SDs in the loci). (3) Merge any intervals if they\nhave at least 50% overlap. (4) Elongate each region by 25% of its length\non either end. (5) Subtract centromeres and ALR repeat regions. (6)\nMerge regions with <100 kbp distance to each other (7) filter to regions\n>40 kbp. The resulting regions contain between one and several\nthousand SV/Inv calls, with region lengths ranging from 40 kbp to 26\nMbp (median: 170.8 kbp). The scripts and all input data are available at\n[https://github.com/WHops/NAHRwhals_rois.](https://github.com/WHops/NAHRwhals_rois)\n\n#### Collection of 48 morbid CNV-regions of interest\nLoci containing disease-associated CNVs were based on four separate\nlists from Cooper et al. (Table 1 in Cooper et al; 44 regions. Table 2 in\nCooper et al: 14 regions) and (Table S2 in Cooper et al.; 19 regions.\nTable S3 in Cooper et al: 36 regions), totaling at 113 loci. All regions\nwere transformed from hg18- to hg38 coordinates using UCSC\nliftover. Next, we applied the same 7-step merging strategy as used\nfor defining 336 SV-Inv-sSV regions (see methods:Collection of 336\nsSV-regions of interest), resulting in 48 nonredundant regions of\ninterest which were subsequently used for analysis.\n\n#### Human and great ape assembled haplotypes\nWe based our analysis on 56 human and four great-ape assemblies. The\nhuman haplotypes consisted of the GRCh38 and CHM13-T2T assemblies and 56 de novo assemblies based on PacBio HiFi reads produced\nby the HGSVC consortium (see Data availability) as previously described (Ebert et al). Samples considered for assemblies were of diverse\nancestry, including individuals from five major superpopulations\n(African: 16 individuals, Ad Mixed American: 3, European: 4, South\nAsian: 1, South East Asian: 4), Phased genome assemblies were created\nin two batches with slightly different procedures:\n\nThe first batch (14 / 28 samples, HG00512, HG00513, HG00514,\n\nHG00731, HG00732, HG00733, HG02818, HG03125, HG03486,\n\nNA12878, NA19238, NA19239, NA19240, NA24385) was produced by an\nimproved version of the PGAS pipeline[,] (PGASv13). Briefly, a nonhaplotype resolved assembly was created with hifiasm v0.15.2 after\nremoving potential adaptor contamination in the HiFi reads. This draft\nassembly was then used as reference in subsequent steps employing\nStrand-seq data to cluster assembled contigs by chromosomes and to\ncreate a phased set of genomic variants during the so-called integrative\nphasing step of PGAS. The phased set of variants then informed the\nhaplotagging of the HiFi reads, leading to two haplotype-specific read\n\n\n-----\n\nsets per sample. The final phased assemblies were then created by\nrunning hifiasm on each haplotype-specific read set. Basic characteristics of the phased assemblies were reported in previous work (see\nEbler et al. , Supplementary Data 1).\n\nAssemblies of the remaining 14 samples (GM19129, GM19434,\n\nHG00171, HG00864, HG02018, HG02282, HG02769, HG02953,\n\nHG03452, HG03520, NA12329, NA19036, NA19983, NA20847) were\nproduced by hifiasm v0.16.1-r375 using PacBio Hifi data of 27.7\u201347.2X\ncoverage. For4 samples with parental short read sequencing data, we\nused the trio binning assembly mode of hifiasm (GM19129, HG02018,\nNA12329, NA19983) and for 6 samples with paired-end short read Hi-C\ndata, we used the Hi-C phasing mode of hifiasm (GM19434, HG02282,\nHG02769, HG02953, HG03452, HG03520). For the remaining 4 samples, hifiasm was run without additional data types (HG00171,\nHG00864, NA19036, NA20847). Six of the samples (GM19129,\nHG02282, HG02769, HG02953, HG03452, HG03520) have not been\nreported on by the HGSVC previously. The average CPU time of hifiasm\nwas 323 h at a peak memory usage of 105 Gb.\n\nAdditionally, four hifiasm-based great-ape assemblies (Bonobo,\n\nChimpanzee, Gorilla and Orangutan) were acquired from a recent\npublication [(available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4721957). In](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4721957)\nthese four datasets, contigs labeled as \u2018primary\u2019 were used.\n\n#### Core-duplicons\nsSV loci were tested for overlap with genes and gene families mapping\nto \u2018core-duplicons\u2019. To create a table of relevant genes, we assembled\na list of 22 prominent core duplicon - associated gene families (NBPF,\nRANBP2, RGPD, PMS2, PPY, C9orf36, ZNF790, SPRYD5, NPIP (also known\nas Morpheus), GOLGA, LRRC37, TBC1D3, USP6, SMN, CCDC127, TRIM51,\nGUSBP, FAM75A, SPATA31, OR7E, DPY19, SPYDE)[,]. We subsequently\nqueried the gencode gene annotation (version 35) for all members of\nthose families, leading to a list of 131 gene instances (Supplementary Data 3).\n\n#### Sequence validation using Strand-Seq\nStrand-Seq is a single-cell DNA sequencing technique which allows to\ninfer the directionality of genomic sequence based on the directionality of strand-specific short-reads mapping to the genome alone.\nStrand-Seq based genotypes were created using the ArbiGent module\nof Mosaicatcher, a software for the analysis of Strand-Seq data[,].\nArbiGent requires a minimum of 500 bp of sequence which can be\nuniquely mapped with short reads, which was the case for 11/37 sSV\nregions for which inversion genotypes were obtained. In two regions,\n\u2018stage-2\u2019-deletions and duplications were mappable with Strandseq\n(chr1:119760829-121619186 and chr1:108185627-108570960), providing exact Strand-Seq genotypes for these loci. In the remaining nine\nregions, StrandSeq reported the presence/absence of inverted\nsequence, which could be cross-checked for consistency with\nNAHRwhals-based SVs (e.g., Nahrwhals: inv-del was considered to be\nconsistent with Stand-Seq: inv). Visualizations of Strand-Seq data were\n[made with a custom pipeline available at: https://github.com/WHops/](https://github.com/WHops/sseq_plot)\n[sseq_plot. For one region, chr1:108185627 INV-DEL and INV-INV, we](https://github.com/WHops/sseq_plot)\nanalyzed the fraction of reads aligning to the segmental duplications in\nforward or reverse orientation (Fig. S24) as a proxy for the amount of\nSD sequence in forward or reverse orientation. For each sample, all\nreads mapping to the largest SD in the region (displayed in green in\nFig. S24) in negative and in positive direction were counted, and the\nfraction of negative-to-positive calculated. To account for read sampling uncertainty due to the low coverage of Strand-seq data we calculated 95% confidence intervals for the real fraction of negative-topositive reads using the binom.test function in R.\n\n#### Integration of NAHRwhals-based calls with external SNPs\nAs part of our analysis of population-based SNP patterns, we combined\nour SV callset with an external SNP callset from. A custom approach\n\n\naround WhatsHap was used to assign the NAHRwhals-based SVs to\nthe corresponding haplotype in the external SNP callset. For each SV,\nthe SV-carrying sequence was extracted from its assembly, cut into\n10kbp-long, non-overlapping chunks and mapped to the hg38 reference. WhatsHap haplotag was then invoked to assign chunks to h1 or\nh2 based on the external SNP callset, and the SV was finally assigned to\nthe haplotype to which the majority of chunks were assigned. The code\n[for this procedure can be found in a github repository: https://github.](https://github.com/WHops/nahrwhals_phasing)\n[com/WHops/nahrwhals_phasing.](https://github.com/WHops/nahrwhals_phasing)\n\n#### Automated sequence validation with Nanopore reads\nWe used ONT reads generated by the HGSV Consortium for 11/\n26 samples - GM19129, HG00512, HG00731, HG00733, HG02282,\nHG02769, HG02818, HG02953, HG03452, HG03520, NA19239 (data\n[availability). After removing adapters with Porechop (https://github.](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop)\n[com/rrwick/Porechop), ONT reads were mapped to both haplotypes of](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop)\ntheir respective samples (i.e., reads from each sample were mapped\nboth to the h1 and h2 assembly). We invoked the sniffles2 SV caller to\nidentify homozygous variants which correspond to assembly regions\nnot supported by any reads, i.e. likely assembly errors. Using the liftover coordinates provided by NAHRwhals, we queried the sequences\ncorresponding to their CHM13-T2T-counterpart individually for each\nassembly.\n\n#### Validation of four morbid CNV-associated regions with Nanopore reads\nFour disease-associated regions were additionally verified using a\nmanual approach. For this, aligned ONT reads were phased post-hoc\nusing \u2018samtools phase\u2019 and visualized in IGV, highlighting discordant\nreads which can be indicative of large-scale rearrangements (Fig. S19).\n\n#### Reporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\nPacBio HiFi sequencing data, Strand-seq as well as Oxford Nanopore sequencing data were generated by the HGSVC consortium\n[and can be accessed through the HGSVC data portal https://www.](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/structural-variation)\n[internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/structural-](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/structural-variation)\n[variation.

However, the lack of direct equivalence between identifiers across these\ndatabases difficults data integration. To address this challenge, we introduce ginmappeR, an integrated R package facilitating the translation of\ngene and protein identifiers between databases. By providing a unified interface, ginmappeR streamlines the integration of diverse data sources\ninto biological workflows, so it enhances efficiency and user experience.\n\n**[Availability and implementation: from Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/packages/ginmappeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ginmappeR)**\n\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nDevelopments in large-scale molecular biology techniques\nsuch as next-generation sequencing (Goodwin _et al._ 2016,\nSatam et al. 2023), microarrays, and other omics techniques\n(Zhang et al. 2019) have led to an explosion in the amount of\navailable biological sequences. This has prompted the creation of multiple databases where researchers deposit the\nsequences identified through a variety of experimental methods. These include, among others, sequences of both genes\nand proteins.\n\nA large amount of modern bioinformatics workflows\n\n(Jacobsen et al. 2020, Reiter et al. 2021) typically involve integrating different sources of information that refer to these\nentities by unique identifiers within each source. That is why,\nnowadays, biological sequence databases offer public programmatic interfaces (APIs) to access their data, like NCBI\n[(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), UniProt (https://www.uni](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)\n[prot.org/), or KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/). Consequently,](https://www.uniprot.org/)\ncommunity developed R packages to consume these services\nare available, such as rentrez (Winter 2017), UniProt.ws\n(Carlson and Ramos 2023), and `KEGGREST (Tenenbaum`\n[2023). Other databases, like CARD (https://card.mcmaster.](https://card.mcmaster.ca/)\n[ca/), offer their data as a downloadable file.](https://card.mcmaster.ca/)\n\nHowever, there is no direct equivalence between the multi\nple sequence identifiers included in the different databases,\nwhich can lead to confusion for their users when searching\nfor information on a particular gene or protein, as well as a\nconsiderable investment of time in the search for equivalences\n\n\nbetween databases. The heterogeneity and low coupling of\nthese tools (Wieder et al. 2021) cause the user\u2019s attention to\nbe diverted from the main task in order to learn minimally\nhow to use each of them. In addition, as free public services,\nthey are prone to a variety of errors, such as random service\ndenial errors or empty responses, that should be specifically\ncontrolled by the user.\n\nThese reasons motivated us to conceive ginmappeR, an in\ntegral R package that translates gene or protein identifiers between the mentioned databases, making it easier for users to\nwork with multiple data sources in a unified and complete\nway. With additional features like UniProt similar genes and\nNCBI identical proteins retrieval, that enrich the translation\nprocess and are highly-demanded for studying gene and protein similarities, their roles across species and their evolutionary relationships; the presented package provides a uniform\nand accessible interface and output for mapping identifiers,\nfacilitating their integration into complex automated workflows. Its technical functionalities such as cache layer, error\nhandling and input vectorisation differentiate it from similar\npackages and make it more efficient and reliable.\n\n### 2 Data sources\n\n\nAntibiotic Resistance Database is a database providing\n\n\nThe biological sequence databases integrated by ginmappeR are:\n\n1) **CARD** (McArthur _et al._ 2013): the Comprehensive\n\n\n**Received: May 7, 2024; Revised: August 9, 2024; Editorial Decision: August 22, 2024; Accepted: August 27, 2024**\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press.\n\n\n-----\n\nup-to-date information on antibiotic resistance mechanisms. It is offered as a centralized repository of curated\ndata on resistance genes, mutations and resistance conditions. CARD aims to facilitate research in tracking,\nunderstanding and combating antibiotic resistance.\n\n2) **NCBI** (Sayers _et al._ 2022): the National Center for\n\nBiotechnology Information is an aggregation of several\nresources on genetical and molecular information such\nas PubMed and GenBank databases, or the BLAST\n(Altschul _et al._ 1990) sequence alignment tool. The\nNCBI Protein database offers information on protein\nsequences, structures, functions and relationships, facilitating research on drug discovery and protein biochemistry. On the other hand, NCBI Nucleotide belongs to\nthe GenBank database and contains nucleotide sequences, both DNA and RNA, from a variety of organisms.\nThe NCBI Gene database stores annotations on genes of\ndifferent organisms, including symbols, names, location\nin the genome and associated phenotypes or diseases.\n\n3) **UniProt** (Consortium 2023): the Universal Protein\n\nResource is a protein sequence database maintained by\nseveral Bioinformatics organisations that offers sequences, annotations, and protein domains data.\n\n4) **KEGG** (Kanehisa and Goto 2000): the Kyoto\n\nEncyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes is a comprehensive database and resource that integrates information\non biological pathways, metabolites, diseases, genomes,\nand organisms. It is a valuable source of complex biological processes at molecular level.\n\nIn terms of covered species, NCBI, UniProt, and KEGG\n\ncontain information on all types of organisms and species,\nwhile CARD, focusing on antibiotic resistance data, is limited\nto bacterial information.\n\nAll of the databases provide publicly accessible APIs and\n\nhave community-developed R packages, except for CARD,\nwhich must be used locally. ginmappeR handles downloading\nthe compressed CARD file from the official server and\ndecompresses it in R\u2019s temporary folder, ensuring that the latest version is retrieved with each session. The decompression\nis managed using the untar() function from R\u2019s utils package, which has been tested to work correctly on Windows,\nMacOS, and Linux. Additionally, ginmappeR offers users the\noption to manually upgrade to the latest version or change\nthe download and decompression path if they have limited\naccess to their machine. When CARD is already available locally, ginmappeR loads the aro_index.tsv file into memory and use it to perform translations between CARD and\nNCBI identifiers.\n\n_ginmappeR accesses the latest available online version of the_\n\ndatabases and downloads the latest update of the CARD database. However, the user can always find out the version used\nwith functions `getCARDVersion(),` `getNCBIVersion(),`\n```\ngetUniProtVersion() and getKEGGVersion().\n\n#### 2.1 Existing tools\n```\nSimilar tools can be found in the literature, such as the DAVID\n[Gene ID Conversion Tool (https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov/](https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov/conversion.jsp)\n[conversion.jsp), a web-based utility that offers interoperability](https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov/conversion.jsp)\nbetween different databases. However, it provides a less userfriendly interface, resulting in a steep learning curve.\n\n\nAdditionally, integrating it into a typical R workflow is challenging due to the outdated RDAVIDWebService (Fresno and\nFernandez 2013) package. The DAVID conversion tool relies\non the DAVID Knowledgebase backend, which aggregates\nspecies-specific gene/protein identifiers and their annotations\nfrom various public genomic resources like NCBI, UniProt,\nEnsembl, KEGG, or Reactome, and is updated every three\n[months. The g: Profiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/convert)](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/convert)\ntool and its associated R package (Kolberg _et al._ 2020) offer\ncomparable functionalities but share the same drawback of being updated every few months, while ginmappeR performs onthe-fly translations by querying each database, which ensures\nthat users always work with the most current data available.\n\nOn the other hand, specific database tools, such as\n```\nUniProt.ws (Carlson and Ramos 2023), offer utilities for\n\n```\nquerying UniProt resources and its identifier conversion tool\nbetween sequence databases, including NCBI and KEGG.\n_ginmappeR_ utilises this tool, `mapUniProt(), to directly`\nconvert between UniProt and NCBI identifiers. Another\npackage, `UniProtR` (Soudy _et al._ 2020), available on\nCRAN, provides similar functionalities to UniProt.ws but\nin a more detailed and accessible manner, although the former was chosen because it underwent Bioconductor\u2019s review\nand acceptance process, which makes it more reliable.\n```\n KEGGREST (Tenenbaum 2023) package provides access to\n\n```\nthe KEGG API and its ID conversion tool, keggConv(), which\nis more limited but allows ginmappeR to perform direct translations between NCBI, KEGG, and UniProt identifiers.\n\nCARD and NCBI databases do not have a dedicated identi\nfier conversion tool. However, `rentrez (Winter 2017)`\nNCBI package accesses its web services and make it possible\nto link between its databases and find equivalences, though\nthis task can be technically challenging and often involves\nworking with XML. _ginmappeR_ handles this using `rent-`\n```\nrez\u2019s entrez_link() and entrez_fetch() functions.\n\n```\nThe direct translations obtained using databases tools are ac\ncurate but often limited as not all genes or proteins find conversion. Therefore, the significant contribution of _ginmappeR_ is\nworking as a central hub that utilises all these tools together,\ncombining them and adding the possibility of using similar or\nidentical genes and proteins when mapping. This significantly\nincreases the success rate of obtaining translations, freeing users\nfrom tedious manual tasks while streamlining the workflow\nand enhancing its flexibility, efficiency, and robustness in gene\nand protein identifier mapping.\n\n### 3 Methods and implementation\n#### 3.1 Methods\nThe R package ginmappeR offers several functionalities:\n\n\n1) Gene and protein identifiers mapping between CARD,\n\nUniProt, KEGG and NCBI Protein, Nucleotide and\nGene databases. This set of features follows an homogeneous presentation to the user: they are provided as\nfunctions with format getX2Y, where X and Y are two\nof the offered databases, and meaning that a given gene\nor protein identifier of database X is being translated to\ndatabase `Y. By default, the translation is performed in`\nthe most accurate and fastest way, but it is highly configurable since, in some cases, it is possible to obtain\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1. (a) ginmappeR\u2019s structure layered design. (b) Example of ginmappeR\u2019s functions code reuse. (c) Translations from CARD database to others.**\n(d) Functions\u2019 parameters showcase. (e) Identical proteins retrieval showcase. (f) Similar genes cluster retrieval showcase. (g) Function vectorization and\noutput format showcase.\n\n\nmultiple translations, including identical proteins or\ngenes, or sequences with a certain percentage of identity.\n\n2) Retrieval of UniProt genes clusters of a certain percentage of\n\nsimilarity, a functionality that is not available in the\n```\n UniProt.ws R package (Carlson and Ramos 2023) for ac\n```\ncess to the UniProt database. Function `getUniProt`\n\n```\n SimilarGenes() allows the user to retrieve genes that\n\n```\nare 100%, 90% or 50% similar to the one given by\nits identifier.\n\n3) Retrieval of NCBI identical proteins, a functionality that is\n\nnot easily accessible and usable in its respective R package\n```\n rentrez (Winter 2017). Providing a NCBI identifier to\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nthe function getNCBIIdenticalProteins(), the user\ncan obtain its identical proteins as a list of identifiers or in\na more detailed format such as a dataframe.\n\n#### 3.2 Structure\nThe implementation of ginmappeR\u2019s mapping functions follows a layered design (Fig. 1a), combining code modularity\nand useful utilities for the user. These layers are:\n\n\n1) **Mapping functionality: the core functionality of**\n\nthe package.\n\n2) **Cache layer: employs the** `memoise (Wickham` _et al._\n\n2021) and cachem (Chang 2023) R packages to cache\nboth final and intermediate results, reducing response\ntimes considerably. This prevents redundant API calls\nwhen users request the conversion of sequence IDs previously carried out or a set of genes of the same family,\nalso reducing the risk of API failure.\n\n3) **Error handling: a layer that manages the different errors**\n\nproduced by the R packages that access the APIs and\nshows appropriate messages to the user. It also avoids\ncaching incorrect results when APIs fail or are\nnot available.\n\n4) **Request handling: because of the unstable nature of**\n\naccessed APIs, this layer handles the requests and is responsible for retrying them several times if an error is\nraised. This mechanism has little impact on execution\ntime and highly improves the usability of the package.\n\n5) **Vectorization: this layer allows the user to map a vector**\n\nof several identifiers in a single call. This is achieved by\nusing the R base Vectorize() function.\n\n6) **Output parsing: takes care of formatting returned results**\n\nin a homogenized way following R functions conventions.\n\n#### 3.3 Implementation\nReuse of code plays a main role in ginmappeR as the translation\nfrom a database to another one usually implies using an intermediate one. Consequently, functions provided by ginmappeR\noften make use of other functions to obtain mid-process translations. Figure 1b shows how function `getCARD2KEGG() first`\nuses `getCARD2NCBI(), and after that, translates the NCBI`\nidentifier to KEGG through getNCBI2KEGG(). This principle\napplies in both directions of each mapping process: For example, when translating from UniProt to CARD, the\n```\ngetUniProt2CARD() function\u2019s workflow is composed by\ngetUniProt2NCBI() and getNCBI2CARD().\n\n```\nIn terms of input and output formats, ginmappeR follows\n\nthe standard behaviour and widely consensual approach of\nvectorized R functions, such as `sqrt() or` `toupper(),`\nallowing the user to provide a single identifier or a vector\ncharacter containing several of them. The output format\ndepends on the function and parameters chosen, but also follows the R convention, returning NA values when no translation is found or an error occurs. When the output is a list\n(triggered by `exhaustiveMapping parameter),` `NA values`\nare replaced by NULL to ensure consistency in the use of functions such as lenghts() to process the result by the user.\n\n\nThrough the use of the functions getCARD2NCBIProtein(),\n`getCARD2NCBINucleotide()` and `getCARD2NCBIGene`\n```\n() it can be translated to NCBI databases (Fig. 1c). In the same\n\n```\nway, functions getCARD2KEGG() and getCARD2UniProt()\nperform the same operation but for KEGG and UniProt databases, respectively.\n\nSome of the translation functions have parameters to obtain\n\nall possible translations (exhaustiveMapping) or to detail\nthe percentage of identity of the source id with the obtained id\n(detailedMapping). They can be used when translating to\nUniProt (Fig. 1d). Further explanation on these and other\nparameters are to be found on package\u2019s documentation.\n\nThe retrieval of identical proteins in the NCBI database offers\n\nthe result as a list of identifiers or as a more detailed dataframe\nformat, depending on parameter `format (Fig. 1e). Obtaining`\nthe cluster of genes of a certain percentage of similarity (Fig. 1f)\nresults in a vector with their identifiers.\n\nWhen providing a vectorised input of several identifiers, a\n\ncharacter vector of the same length with the translations will\nbe returned. If parameter exhaustiveMapping is TRUE, it\nwill return a list instead of a character vector to avoid mixing\nthe identifiers, as it may retrieve more than one for each input\ngene or protein (Fig. 1g).\n\n### 5 Conclusions\n\n\nIn this application note, we have introduced _ginmappeR, a_\ncomprehensive R package that provides a unified and accessible interface for gene and protein identifier mapping. By integrating various biological sequence databases, _ginmappeR_\naddresses the challenges of database heterogeneity and low\ncoupling, enabling users to seamlessly work with multiple\ndata sources in a cohesive and efficient manner. Additionally,\n_ginmappeR offers unique utilities, such as accessing UniProt_\nsimilar genes and NCBI identical proteins, which enhance the\nflexibility and richness of the mapping process.

However, visual analysis of high-dimensional transcriptomic, proteomic, genome-mapped and imaging data types simultaneously remains a challenge. Here we describe Vitessce, an interactive web-based visualization framework for exploration of multimodal and spatially resolved single-cell data. We demonstrate integrative visualization of millions of data points, including cell-type annotations, gene expression quantities, spatially resolved transcripts and cell segmentations, across multiple coordinated views. The open-source software is available at  http://vitessce.io.\n\n\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n\n\nTechniques for characterizing tissues and organs at single-cell resolution have recently overcome the challenges of spatial localization\nand measurement of multiple modalities, improving our ability to\ndistinguish cell types, cell states and cell neighborhoods. The high\ndimensionality of single-cell omics and imaging data has catalyzed\nthe development of computational models designed to annotate cellular observations with segmentations, cluster memberships and predicted cell types. Visual analysis of multimodal and spatially resolved\nsingle-cell datasets which integrate genomics, transcriptomics and\nimaging modalities can facilitate quality control, communication of\nresults, identification of biomarkers and generation of hypotheses.\n\nDespite experimental and computational advances in the field, there\n\nremains a lack of scalable tools for interactive visualization of multimodal\nand spatial single-cell datasets. The lack of sufficient tools for visual\nanalysis of heterogeneous biological datasets, termed \u2018the challenge\nof ultrascale integrative visualomics\u2019, has been highlighted by the visualization research community[,]. Visualization of multimodal single-cell\ndatasets currently requires multiple disconnected tools such as image\nviewers and genome browsers which support individual data modalities. Tools that facilitate discovery of connections across modalities will\nenable multimodal experimental data to be used to their full potential to\nimprove understanding of health, disease and regulatory mechanisms.\n\n\nRecent tools for visualization of single-cell data have focused on\n\ninteractivity and scalability. Tools such as Cellxgene, Cirrocumulus\nand Pagoda2 support interactive exploration of datasets containing millions of cells and thousands of genes using scatterplots and\nheatmaps. However, these tools are designed for visual analysis of\ntranscriptomics data. As a result, they lack support for spatial data\ntypes such as cell segmentations or genome-mapped modalities such\nas chromatin accessibility profiles. On the other hand, tools designed\nfor spatial data such as TissUUmaps and Napari-SpatialData do not\nsupport nonspatial or genome-mapped data visualization. The focus\nso far on single-modality data has resulted in tools that do not support\nvisualization tasks such as comparison and relation across modalities\nand in spatial context.\n\nWe developed Vitessce to overcome these limitations and enable\n\nintegrative visualization of multimodal and spatial single-cell data.\nVitessce is a scalable web-based data visualization framework that supports simultaneous visual exploration of transcriptomics, proteomics,\ngenome-mapped and imaging modalities (Fig. 1). For example, the\nsoftware provides modules based on Viv and HiGlass toolkits for visualization of multiscale multiplexed imaging data and genome-mapped\ndata, respectively (Fig. 2). A strength of Vitessce that distinguishes it\nfrom prior work is the ability to deploy visualizations of spatial and\n\n\n1Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 2Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.\n\n3Present address: Altos Labs San Diego CA USA [e mail: nils@hms harvard edu](mailto:nils@hms.harvard.edu)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### a\n\n b\n\n|Jupyter Notebook (Python)|Rstudio viewer, RMarkdown and shiny (R)|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nHTTP\n\n\nWeb browser (JavaScript)\n\nFile types AnnData\n\n... ...\n\nFile formats\n\nView types\n\n...\n\nData types\n\n|AnnData|MuData|SpatialData|OME-NGFF|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n|File Data type|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n|CSV|JSON|\n|---|---|\n\n|Configuration|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Dataset File Data ... ... type Coordination Layout View View ...|||File types AnnData MuData SpatialData OME-NGFF Multivec Plugin CSV JSON OME-TIFF file types File formats Zarr Spatial Genome Statistical Control Plugin View types Scatterplot and Heatmap browser plots views view imaging tracks types|\n||Layout View View ...|||\n|||||\n\n\n##### c\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nDataset File Data\ntype\n\nCoordination\n\nLayout View\n\nMultimodal and spatial\nsingle-cell experiments\n\n\nStandard web server or cloud object storage\n\nPlugin\n\nCSV JSON OME-TIFF file\n\ntypes\n\nGenome Statistical Control Plugin\nbrowser plots views view\ntracks types\n\nObservation coordinates\n\n\nObservation embedding\nEmbedding coordinates\n\nObservation sets\n\n\n_X, Y, Z_\n\n\nObservations Features\n\nProtein\n\n\nFeature indices and labels\n\nProtein ID Gene ID Genomic coordinates\n\nObservation by feature matrices\n\n\nRNA\n\n\nClustering results,\ncell type annotations\n\nObservation segmentations\n\n\nPolygons,\nlabel images\n\nObservation by feature matrix\nDerived quantities\n\n\nChromatin\n\nSpatial and imaging\n\n\n_X_\n\n\nObservation by feature matrix\n\nGenomic profiles\n\n\nImage\n\n\n_Y_\n\n\n(Z, T, C, pyramid resolution)\n\n\n**Fig. 1 | Vitessce can be used in multiple settings and can be configured to**\n**visualize raw and derived measurements from multimodal and spatial single-**\n**cell experiments.** **a, Vitessce can be used as a JavaScript component in a web**\nbrowser or a widget in Python and R analysis environments. b, Single-cell, singlemolecule and microscopy data stored in multiple formats can be visualized\nin multiple types of views (that is, interactive visualizations). c, The modular\ndesign of Vitessce enables integrative visualization of multimodal and spatial\nsingle-cell experiments alongside computational analysis results.

This audience includes\nsingle-cell data analysts intending to communicate results with collaborators, readers of publications who are interested in questions\nbeyond those answered by static figures and consumers of single-cell\ndatabases interested in checking data quality before follow-up studies.\nThe framework addresses five key challenges to enable a wide audience to construct, deploy and access visualizations of multimodal and\nspatially resolved single-cell data:\n\n1. **Tailor visualizations to problem-specifc data and biological**\n\n**questions: Depending on the experimental approach, a single-cell**\ndataset may contain one or more modalities with or without spatial coordinates and images (Fig. 1c). Downstream analysis approaches vary widely and result in derived data types such as dimensionality reductions, clusterings, cell-type annotations and\ncell segmentations. Heterogeneity in data types and in the types\nof questions asked by single-cell biologists require diferent visual\nrepresentations and interactions, for example, moving between\nexpression and physical space. For multimodal datasets, analysts\ncan use Vitessce to visualize modalities independently (that is,\ndiferent modalities in diferent plots) or to visualize the precomputed results of an integration method that projects multiple modalities into a shared low-dimensional space.\n\nVitessce enables visual analysis of a patchwork of data types\n\nandsupportsmultipletypesofquestionsbyprovidingacollection\n\n\n##### c\n\n d\n\n e\n\n\nImage only Feature values Observation sets Static colors\n\nJuxtaposed Superimposed Both\n\nof supported visualization layers in the spatial view of Vitessce, namely, points,\nspots, segmentations and images. Spot and segmentation layers can be colored\nby feature values, set membership or static colors. e, Vitessce supports both\njuxtaposed and superimposed arrangements of multiple spatially resolved\nvisualizations. Chr, chromosome; t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding; UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection.\n\nof interactive views that can be linked and coordinated using a\nmodular approach. These views enable visualization of datasets\ncontaining highly multiplexed images, cell and organelle segmentations, cell-by-gene expression matrices, cell-by-peak count\nmatrices, cluster-level chromatin accessibility profiles, flat and\nhierarchical cell-type annotations, and dimensionality reductions.\nMultiple views can be arranged in a grid layout that allows simultaneous visualization of data from multiple experiments. The views\nin Vitessce are designed to scale to large datasets. For example,\nthe scatterplots can display millions of cells and the heatmaps\ncan display tens of thousands of features (for example, genes,\nproteins or chromatin accessibility peaks) by using WebGL and\ndeck.gl. Viv, HiGlass and Vega-Lite are used to support visualization of multigigabyte images, genome-wide measurements\nand basic statistical analyses, respectively. We provide documentation to facilitate development of additional view types as plugins\n(Supplementary Note 1).\n\n2. **Integrate and explore multimodal data with coordinated**\n\n**multiple views: Visual analysis of multimodal and spatial**\nsingle-cell data involves identifcation and relation of patterns\nthat span modalities and data types. The current ecosystem of\ndisparate tools such as genome, scatterplot and image browsers\nmakes such tasks di#cult. Vitessce addresses the challenge of\nrelation across modalities by supporting coordinated multiple\nviews, enabling interactions such as selection of genes and cell\ntypes to be refected in multiple visualizations (Fig. 1b). Visualization producers can confgure any subset of views to be linked\non any subset of over 50 parameters, including visualization\nproperties and user preferences Changes in coordinated values\n\n\n-----\n\nare refected in confguration updates, enabling snapshots of\nstate to be captured. Confgurations can be saved and shared via\nuniform resource locator (URL), making the interactive visualization reproducible and trackable.\n\n3. **Explore visualizations in diferent computational environ-**\n\n**ments: Visual inspection of data is crucial to single-cell data**\nanalysis. Vitessce can be integrated directly into not only web\napplications, but also exploratory computing environments\nwhere data analysis is performed. In Jupyter Notebooks and\nRMarkdown, Vitessce can be used as an interactive widget to\nvisualize analysis results alongside the corresponding code\n(Fig. 1b). Vitessce R and Python widgets are accompanied by objectoriented application programming interfaces (APIs) to simplify\nconfguration. Widgets can be confgured with local or remote\ndata, enabling visualization of datasets that may be located in\nthe cloud or on a compute cluster. These APIs are compatible\nwith the data structures used by popular single-cell data analysis packages, including Scanpy[,], SnapATAC and Seurat.\nExport functions are included in the APIs to simplify remote\ndata hosting.\n\n4. **Deploy and share interactive visualizations: Interactive visuali-**\n\nzations can be more dynamic, scalable, shareable and easier to deploy when they do not rely on a specialized server, as Manz et al.\ndemonstrate for multiplexed bioimaging visualizations. Implemented as a client-side web application without server-side requirements, Vitessce loads data from static fles stored on standard web servers or cloud object storage systems including Google\nCloud Storage and Amazon Web Services S3. Data loading, transformation and rendering processes in Vitessce are performed\ndirectly in the web browser. While the JavaScript framework itself\ndoes not rely on a specialized server, integrations with server-side\ncomputing infrastructure can be achieved through the development of plugin views which rely on such infrastructure internally. This is demonstrated by Cheng et al. in plugin views that\ncommunicate with a specialized server for data integration in a\nhuman-in-the-loop setting.\n\n5. **Access data from multiple fle formats: The community lacks**\n\nconsensus fle formats for single-cell measurements and microscopy images. This can be attributed in part to the existence\nof proprietary fle formats, an ecosystem fragmented along programming language boundaries and the nature of emerging experimental methods whose outputs do not conform to existing\nformats. While minimum information standards for metadata\nhave been proposed[,], several fle formats are commonly used\nto store single-cell and imaging data in the analysis ecosystem[,].\nTo address this challenge, Vitessce abstracts data loading from visualization rendering, enabling support for multiple fle formats,\nincluding CSV, AnnData[,], MuData, SpatialData, Multivec,\nJSON, OME-TIFF and OME-Zarr[,]. Data stored in novel fle formats can also be visualized in Vitessce through the development\nof plugin data loading modules (Supplementary Note 1).\n\nVitessce enables visual exploration of single-cell experiments,\n\nwhich span the modalities of transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and imaging within a single integrative tool. We demonstrate the\nconstruction, deployment and access of visualizations through use\ncases in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 1\u20137.\n\nIn a CITE sequencing use case, Vitessce can be used to validate\n\nthe presence of cell types characterized by markers in both RNA and\nprotein modalities. Stoeckius et al. measure gene expression and\nsurface protein abundance in a sample of human cord blood mononuclear cells, investigating well-characterized immune cell-type\nmarkers in these modalities. The findings of Stoeckius et al. can be\nreproduced by visualizing the dataset in Vitessce using linked scatterplotsandheatmapstoexploreproteinabundanceandgeneexpression\n\n\nlevels simultaneously (Extended Data Fig. 5). For instance, we observe\nthat natural killer cells can be identified on the basis of CD56 protein\nlevels and the expression of genes GZMB, GZMK and PRF1, as reported\nby the authors.\n\nA second use case demonstrates visualization of spatially\n\nresolved gene expression data from a single-molecule fluorescence\nin situ hybridization experiment. In a mouse brain sample, Codeluppi et al. discovered a transition region between the pyramidal\nL2/3 and L4 neuronal cell types that contains pyramidal L3/4 cells.\nThis finding can be reproduced in Vitessce using the spatial plot\nand heatmap views (Fig. 2a). In Vitessce, the colors of cell segmentations and scatterplot points can be mapped to gene expression\nvalues. Through interactive selection of the genes Lamp5 and Rorb,\nwe observe the reported co-expression pattern that is specific to the\npyramidal L3/4 cells.\n\nThe development of Vitessce has been propelled by collaboration\n\nwith cell atlas consortia. Usage of the framework in the data portals\nfor the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) and Kidney\nPrecision Medicine Project (KPMP), as well as its open development on GitHub, has led to valuable feedback that has informed the\nrequirements and future research directions. Future directions for\nVitessce include comparative analysis support, increased scalability\nand additional visualization types for three-dimensional tissue maps\nand genome-mapped data.\n\nDecoupled from any particular database, Vitessce can be inte\ngrated as a visualization frontend into projects with varying backend\ndata organization strategies. The modularity and extensibility of the\nframework allows for supporting additional visualization types, file\nformats and single-cell modalities as they emerge. We anticipate that\nthe community will embrace these characteristics by contributing\nplugin modules and incorporating Vitessce into applications that\nprovide affordances for specific audiences, tasks and technologies.\n\n### Online content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information,\nacknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code avail[ability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02436-x.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02436-x)\n\n### References\n1.

Researchers can use the R and Python packages to explore\nlocal or remote datasets during data analysis. The Vitessce website\nand online configuration editor are designed for sharing visualizations with collaborators and debugging. Software developers can\nincorporate Vitessce into other tools and write plugins by using it as\na JavaScript package.\n\n**Vitessce in Python environments and Jupyter Notebooks. Vitessce**\ncan be used as a Python package in scripts and Jupyter notebooks.\nVisualizations can be configured and rendered directly into notebooks using an interactive widget that is compatible with multiple\nnotebook environments including JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook (classic) and Google Colab. The implementation of the widget is based\n[on AnyWidget (https://anywidget.dev). Installation instructions and](https://anywidget.dev/)\n[API documentation can be found at https://python-docs.vitessce.io.](https://python-docs.vitessce.io)\n[A set of tutorial notebooks is available at https://github.com/vitessce/](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-python-tutorial)\n[vitessce-python-tutorial.](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-python-tutorial)\n\n**Vitessce in R environments, RMarkdown, RStudio and Shiny apps.**\nVitessce can be used as an R package in scripts, RMarkdown documents\nand Shiny apps. Visualizations configured in R can be rendered using an\ninteractive widget in the RStudio Viewer pane, RMarkdown documents,\npkgdown websites and Shiny apps. The widget is implemented as an R\nhtmlwidget. Installation instructions and API documentation can be\n[found at https://r-docs.vitessce.io.](https://r-docs.vitessce.io)\n\n**Vitessce in JavaScript and web environments. Vitessce is imple-**\nmented in JavaScript as a React component with corresponding APIs for\nconfiguration and registering plugins (described below). The JavaScript\npackage can be used in websites, other React components or other\nJavaScript packages. Installation instructions and API documentation\n[can be found at http://vitessce.io.](http://vitessce.io)\n\n**Vitessce as a website and online configuration editor. To quickly**\nconfigure a Vitessce visualization from a web browser, we provide a\nweb application to write and edit Vitessce configurations using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and JavaScript syntax. This method of\nconfiguring a Vitessce instance does not require Python, R or JavaScript\n[package installation. This resource can be found at http://vitessce.io.](http://vitessce.io)\n\n**Python, R and JavaScript configuration APIs. Vitessce configura-**\ntions are defined using a JSON representation that specifies the view\nlayout and points to local or remote data files via URLs. In addition\nto the declarative JSON representation, we have developed Python,\nR and JavaScript APIs to enable users to define configurations programmatically. These configuration APIs support definition of datasets,\nfiles, views, the view layout and view coordinations within the native\nobject-oriented paradigms of each language.\n\n**JavaScript plugin API. The Vitessce JavaScript package contains func-**\ntions for defining plugin view types, coordination types, data types and\nfile types. Once plugins have been defined, they must be registered by\nproviding a name that will be used to refer to the implementation in\nVitessce configurations. Plugin view types must be implemented as\nReact components. We provide examples and tutorials for using the\nplugin API on the Vitessce documentation website.\n\n##### Multimodal configuration\nVitessce supports arbitrary multimodal datasets by adopting the\nobservation-by-feature matrix conventions used by data analysis packages in the single-cell ecosystem including MultiAssayExperiment,\nSeurat and MuData In this model observations are entities being\n\n\nmeasured, such as cells, molecules, spots, beads or nuclei. Features\nare the characteristics being measured about entities such as genes,\nchromatin accessibility peaks or surface proteins. Feature values are\nthe quantities being measured, such as expression levels, counts or\nintensities. Identifiers for types of observation, feature and feature\nvalue can be defined in the Vitessce configuration for both data and\nviews. Vitessce then matches views to data accounting for observation\ntype, feature type and/or value type identifiers. For most views and data\ntypes, all three properties are used, but a subset or a superset may be\nused depending on which properties are relevant to a particular view.\nFor example, the heatmap considers all three properties when loading data because the visualization contains features, observations\nand values. A particular heatmap can be uniquely identified by these\nproperties. In contrast, the feature list view is uniquely identified by\nonly feature type and therefore observation type and value type are\nnot considered when loading data for the view.\n\n##### Data organization\nTo separate data loading from rendering and support multimodal\nexperiments, Vitessce views load data corresponding to datasets\nand data types, such as arrays of spatial coordinates per observation,\ndimensionality reduction coordinates per observation, images and\nobservation-by-feature matrices. Views may load data corresponding\nto one or more datasets and one or more data types. These data types\nmay be aligned on certain axes (for example, to support shared observation or feature sets) or not (for example, to support comparison of\nmultiple datasets).\n\nData types are loaded independently such that their data may be\n\ncontained in the same file or split across independent files, allowing\nmultiple file formats to be used to load each dataset. Vitessce defines\nmultiple file types that correspond to data type\u2013file format pairs. If a\nfile format supports multiple data types, a joint file type may be defined\nto simplify the configuration (that is, allowing URLs and file options to\nbe defined once for a file while being exposed as multiple data types\ninternally). For example, AnnData objects, which may contain multiple\nobservation-by-feature matrices, dimensionality reductions and spatial coordinates, can be configured using a higher-level joint file type\nthat is specific to AnnData. However these specifics are abstracted\nfrom the implementations of views that simply perform lookups for\ndata corresponding to individual data types.\n\n**On-demand loading of data subsets. To scale to large datasets, data**\nloading is deferred in multiple cases: multiscale images, multiscale\nbitmask-based segmentations, genome-mapped data and per-feature\nsubsets of observation-by-feature matrices. The loading of highly\nmultiplexed multiscale (that is, pyramidal) image files is implemented\nusing Viv. As described by Manz et al., Viv loads images as data tiles\ncorresponding to the current viewport zoom level (that is, resolution)\nand target position (that is, X/Y), as well as selections for channel (C),\ntemporal (T) and Z axes. In Vitessce, this approach applies not only to\nprimary images but also to image bitmask files for cell and organelle\nsegmentations, which can also be stored in multiresolution formats.\n\nScalability to large observation-by-feature matrices in Vitessce\n\ntakes advantage of a similar data tiling approach. These matrices can be\nstored in multiple Zarr-based file formats, in particular when using AnnData[,], MuData and SpatialData. Zarr supports tiled (\u2018chunked\u2019) and\ncompressed multidimensional arrays that can be served as directories\nof static files termed \u2018stores\u2019. Benchmarking conducted by Moore et al.\ndemonstrates that accessing Zarr data is at least as fast as accessing the\nsame data stored in hierarchical data format version 5 (HDF5) and TIFF,\nand in high-latency cloud storage scenarios, Zarr outperforms HDF5\nby an order of magnitude.\n\nThe Zarr chunk strategy can be configured to optimize for par\nticular use cases. In Vitessce, performance is optimized when many\nobservations and few features are stored in each chunk enabling use\n\n\n-----\n\ncases such as quickly loading the expression values for a particular\ngene (that is, one feature) across all cells (that is, all observations).\nThe trade-off is that the same chunk strategy might result in poor\nperformance under a different use case such as loading expression\nvalues for all genes for only one cell. We additionally compare the full\nsizes of Zarr and CSV-based AnnData objects in Supplementary Fig. 7.\n\nGenome browser tracks visualized using HiGlass also load data\n\ntiles on-demand based on the current browser viewport and zoom\nlevel, as described by Kerpedjiev et al.. In Vitessce, we extend this\nmechanism to support genomic data from Zarr stores (in addition to\nthe existing file formats supported by HiGlass) to eliminate the dependency on a specialized HiGlass Server. This extension is implemented as\na HiGlass plugin data fetcher.\n\n##### Coordinated multiple views\nVitessce adopts the coordinated multiple views technique from the field\nof information visualization to enable comparison tasks, such as overview\nand detail, focus and context, difference views and small multiples[,].\n\n**Coordination model. The coordination model proposed by Boukhelifa**\net al. is used to link subsets of views on visualization, interaction and\ndata properties. In this model, views are not directly linked to one\nanother, but instead to named property values referred to as coordination scopes. The properties that views can be linked on are referred to\nas coordination types. As a result, views are coordinated when they are\nlinked to the same coordination scope for a given coordination type.\n\n##### JavaScript implementation\nVitessce is implemented as a configurable React component in JavaScript. Below the root React component, visualization and control\nviews are also implemented as React components. Views for visualization may use any web technologies including WebGL, SVG, CSS and the\nHTML canvas element. The main Vitessce component is distributed in a\nJavaScript package that also exports an object-oriented configuration\nAPI and plugin APIs for defining custom views as React components,\nfile types as JavaScript classes and coordination types.\n\n**Implementation of coordinated multiple views. We have imple-**\nmented the aforementioned coordination model in JavaScript and\nincorporated it into the Vitessce configuration schema using a JSON\nrepresentation. As we anticipate that this may be useful for general\nimplementation of coordinated multiple view visualizations using\nJavaScript, we provide the implementation as a standalone JavaScript\npackage that can be used in conjunction with the plugin API.\n\n**Implementation of views. Vitessce configurations define a set of**\nviews that contain interactive visualizations. View implementations\nare independent of one another and use custom React hook functions\nto access values from the coordination model and load data. The views\ncurrently available include a scatterplot, spatial plot, heatmap, cell set\nsize bar chart, gene expression histogram, gene expression per cell set\nviolin plots, cell set manager, gene selection, image layer controller and\ngenomic profile per cell set genome browser. Views for visualization\nare implemented using custom JavaScript code and existing JavaScript\nlibraries for statistical and geospatial data visualization. A list of the\nmajor open-source software packages used and a list of views currently\navailable are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n**Implementation of custom deck.gl layers. The implementations**\nof several views including the heatmap, scatterplot, and spatial views\nleverage the extensibility of the deck.gl API for WebGL-based data\nvisualization. Deck.gl exposes not only high-level JavaScript APIs\n(\u2018layers\u2019) for rendering points, lines, polygons and text, but also abstractions for developing custom layers with associated custom WebGL\nshader programs The heatmap is implemented using a custom layer\n\n\nthat performs aggregation on the graphic processing unit (GPU) of\nneighboring values in an observation-by-feature matrix when multiple\nvalues correspond to only a single pixel on the screen. This eliminates\nthe aliasing and Moir\u00e9 patterns that would otherwise occur at low zoom\nlevels of a large matrix in the heatmap view, while preserving smooth\nzoom and pan interactions. The custom heatmap layer also contains\nlogic which restricts pan interactions to the matrix area and determines\nhow to display axis ticks on the basis of zoom level and text length. The\nspatial view is implemented using multiple custom layers, including\none which renders image bitmasks by extending from Viv layers. The\nspatial and scatterplot views both use a custom layer, which efficiently\nmaps feature values to colors on the GPU using quantitative colormap\nfunctions written in WebGL.\n\n**Implementation of data loading. Data are loaded using HTTP from static**\nfiles on local or remote web servers. Files corresponding to one or more\ndatasets are specified via an array of URLs and file types in the configuration. Certain file types accept options that specify details of the internal\nfile organization to enable lookups (for example, to load particular arrays\nwithin Zarr stores by specifying their relative paths). Each file type is\nloaded by a corresponding JavaScript class that defines a required load\nfunction and optional functions to load data subsets (where file formats\nallow). Data loading classes may perform validation, in particular when\nfile formats such as JSON are used, which may vary widely in their contents. A list of supported file types is provided in Supplementary Table 3.\n\n##### Processing of data for use cases\nData for use cases shown in Fig. 2 was processed using Python scripts,\nJupyter notebooks and Snakemake pipelines (Extended Data Figs. 1,\n3 and 6). Vitessce visualizations were configured using the Vitessce\nPython package. Configurations were exported to JSON files and\nuploaded to the GitHub Gist service to enable referencing them by\nURL. Files obtained from the HuBMAP Data Portal were processed by\nautomated pipelines developed within the HuBMAP Infrastructure and\nEngagement Collaboratory.\n\n##### Reporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n### Data Availability\nAll data shown in figures are available under permissive licenses.

To overcome this limitation, we d ev el oped P ro te in Ge ne- rator (PG), a sequence space difusion model based on RoseTTAFold that simultaneously generates protein sequences and structures. Beginning from a noised sequence representation, PG generates sequence and structure pairs by iterative denoising, guided by desired sequence and structural protein attributes. We designed thermostable proteins with varying amino acid compositions and internal sequence repeats and cage bioactive peptides, such as melittin. By averaging sequence logits between difusion trajectories with distinct structural constraints, we designed m ul ti st ate parent\u2013child protein triples in which the same sequence folds to diferent supersecondary structures when intact in the parent versus split into two child domains. PG design trajectories can be guided by experimental sequence\u2013activity data, providing a general approach for integrated computational and experimental optimization of protein f un ct ion.\n\n\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n\n\nProtein function arises from a complex interplay of sequence and\nstructural features; hence, designing new protein functions requires\nreasoning over both sequence and structure space. Many protein design\nmethods sample structures and sequences in separate steps, typically by generating protein backbones first and using inverse folding\nmethods to generate sequences. Traditional methods, such as Rosetta\nflexible backbone protein design, alternate between structure and\nsequence design, whereas recent deep-learning-based approaches[\u2013]\n\n\ntypically generate backbones first and then use sequence design\nmethods, such as ProteinMPNN (MPNN), to identify sequences that fold\ninto a given backbone[,]. Among the latter class of approaches, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), which have shown considerable promise in continuous data domains, allow for the generation of\nprotein backbones subject to a wide range of structural constraints.\nDDPMs approximate the probability density function over a data distribution by learning to denoise samples corrupted with Gaussian noise,\n\n\n1Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. 2Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.\n\n3Graduate Program in Biological Physics, Structure and Design, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. 4Department of Molecular Engineering,\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

Although powerful, structure-based approaches,\nsuch as RFdiffusion and Chroma, provide limited opportunities\nto guide protein generation using sequence-based features and to\nidentify sequences with more than one fold and/or function. Hallucination approaches that apply activation maximization to structure\nprediction networks[,] can generate sequence\u2013structure pairs without\nadditional training, but these solutions can be adversarial and require\na large number of steps to converge, and robust experimental success\nrequires subsequent sequence design on the hallucinated backbones.\n\nWe reasoned that carrying out diffusion in sequence space\n\nrather than structure space could enable guidance of design using\nsequence-based features and explicit design of sequences populating multiple states. To enable conditioning on both sequence and\nstructure features, we start from the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network, which we treat as a mapping from input sequence and\nstructure information to an output sequence and structure, as in the\ncase of RFdiffusion (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). We reasoned that\nRoseTTAFold could be adapted for sequence space diffusion by noising\n[the sequences of proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.](http://www.rcsb.org/)\n[rcsb.org/) and training to remove the noise while imposing a loss on](http://www.rcsb.org/)\nstructure prediction accuracy, thus ensuring that the resulting model\nhas a deep understanding of both sequence and structure.\n\n### Results\n##### Categorical DDPM implementation and fine-tuning\nWe implement diffusion and data noising in categorical space by\nrepresenting protein sequences as scaled one-hot tensors (for native\nsequences, true values are set to 1 and all other values set to \u22121) and\nembed via a linear layer, allowing for progressive corruption with Gaussian noise N(\u00b5 = 0, % = 1)[,]. This approach has the advantage over carrying out diffusion in a learned embedding space[,] of simplifying the\nuse of raw sequence-based classifiers for guidance. To fine-tune RoseTTAFold, we input protein sequences progressively noised according\nto a square root schedule, the corresponding timestep and optional\nstructural information and train the model to generate ground truth\nsequence\u2013structure pairs by applying a categorical cross-entropy\nloss to the predicted sequence (relative to the ground truth sequence)\nand FAPE structure loss on the predicted structure (Algorithm S1 and\nSupplementary Fig. 2). Self-conditioning was found to improve training and inference performance. Protein generation begins with an L\u00d720\ndimensional sequence of Gaussian noise and a black-hole initialized\nstructure; at each timestep (xt), the model predicts x0 from xt, after\nwhich x0 is noised to xt\u22121 (Fig. 1b). Sequence-based guidance can be\ncombined with x0 to guide the model toward a constrained sequence\nspace using activity data, sequence-specific potentials or other information (Fig. 1b). Fixed motifs in the input sequence are featurized\nwith an extra token to denote that the sequence is not diffused at this\nposition. Secondary structure conditioning information is passed\nvia the one-dimensional (1D) track, whereas three-dimensional (3D)\ncoordinates are embedded via the pair features in the two-dimensional\n(2D) track and coordinates in the 3D track. Embeddings from these\nthree tracks are linked by cross-attention in the RoseTTAfold architecture, allowing for the output sequence from the 1D track to condition\nthe others.\n\nDuring inference, we obtain x0 from xt and generate xt\u22121 by noising\n\n**x0; we found sampling xt\u22121 ~q(xt\u22121 | x0) more effective than sampling**\nfrom xt\u22121 ~q(xt\u22121 | x0, xt) (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Algorithm S2).\nProteinGenerator (PG) outperforms early hallucination methods in\nunconditional design accuracy and generates structurally diverse proteins when sampled from different Gaussian mixture models (Supplementary Figs. 4\u20136). PG readily designs proteins that scaffold specified\nstructural motifs; AlphaFold2 (ref. 19) (AF2)-predicted structures accuratelyrecapitulate(rootmeansquaredeviation(RMSD)todesign < 2\n\n\nmotif RMSD < 1, AF2 pAE < 5) both the motif and the full design (Fig. 4c\nand Supplementary Fig. 8). RFdiffusion followed by MPNN performs\nbetter on motif scaffolding and unconditional generation of larger\nproteins (Supplementary Fig. 5c). PG sequence quality as measured\nby ESM pseudo-perplexity, which was previously shown to be indicative of experimental success[,], is indistinguishable from those of\nnative sequences sampled from UniProt and considerably higher\nthan sequences generated using a 640-million-parameter sequence\ndiffusion model, EvoDiff (Supplementary Fig. 5d,e).\n\nUnconditional generation using PG yields sequence\u2013structure\n\npairs with amino acid compositions resembling those of native proteins\n(Supplementary Fig. 7). Structure predictions from AF2 and ESMFold of the generated sequences are close to the designed structures\nand confident (6% of designs have AF2 confidence pLDDT > 90 and\nRMSD < 2 \u212b; Supplementary Figs. 3 and 5; computational success rates\nfor all design tasks can be found in Supplementary Table 1). We experimentally characterized unconditionally generated 70\u201380-residue\nproteins by testing solubility and monomericity via size-exclusion\nchromatography (SEC), folding by circular dichroism (CD) and stability\nby CD thermal melts (we use these methods throughout this study to\nevaluate protein behavior as the design criteria increase in complexity).\nOf the 42 proteins experimentally tested, 32 were soluble and monomeric by SEC, and CD experiments showed that they had the designed\nsecondary structure and were stable up to 95 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 9).\n\n##### Design of rare amino acid enriched proteins\nAn advantage of diffusion in sequence space is that sequence-based\nguiding functions can be readily implemented and applied. To evaluate the ability of PG to reason over sequence\u2013structure relationships\noutside the PDB training distribution, we sought to design proteins\nenriched in evolutionarily undersampled amino acids that confer structural or functional properties (Fig. 2a). Given a specification of the\ndesired amino acid content, at each denoising step, sequence positions\nare ranked based on the frequency of the amino acid of interest, and,\nfor the top N positions (where N is the number of desired occurrences\nof the amino acid), a bias toward the desired amino acid is added to\nthe update generating xt\u22121 (Algorithm S3). We used this procedure to\ngenerate proteins with high frequencies (20% composition) of tryptophan, cysteine, valine, histidine and methionine (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 10a\u2013e) with sequences very distinct from those of\nnative proteins (Fig. 2c). Generated designs were filtered for high AF2\nconfidence (pLDDT > 90) and self-consistency (RMSD to design < 2 \u212b),\nand 96 were selected for experimental characterization.\n\nOf the expressed designs, 68 were soluble in Escherichia coli, and\n\nfour of five upweighted cysteine proteins, eight of 19 upweighted\ntryptophan proteins, 19 of 22 upweighted valine proteins, 10 of 12\nupweighted histidine proteins and 10 of 10 upweighted methionine\nproteins were found to be monomeric by SEC (Supplementary Fig. 10g).\nCD spectra were obtained for a subset of the monomeric designs, and,\nin all cases, the indicated secondary structure was consistent with the\ndesign and thermostable (Fig. 2e\u2013h). Guiding for high cysteine content\nat the sequence level resulted in the formation of 3\u20134 disulfide bonds\nper protein without any structural conditioning, as indicated by mass\nspectrometry in the presence and absence of the reducing agent TCEP\nat 50 mM (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Figs. 11\u201315). Proteins designed\nwith upweighted tryptophans exhibited high absorbance at 280 nm\nand had helical CD traces (Fig. 2f). Proteins with upweighted valine\nexhibited higher beta-sheet content (Supplementary Fig. 10f) by CD, as\nexpected given the secondary structure propensity of valine, and were\nthermostable (Fig. 2h). These results indicate that the model can reason\nover sequence\u2013structure relationships beyond native protein-like\nsequence compositions to design folded, thermostable proteins with\ndesired sequence properties.\n\nWe further explored the generation of proteins with pre-specified\n\ncharge composition isoelectric points and hydrophobicity\n\n\n-----\n\n##### a\n\n b\n\n\n##### c d\n\nProtein\n\nGenerator\n\nGuided Seq\n\n\nPG MAX\nBO MAX\n\n\nPG\nBO\n\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\nIterative design\n\n\nTrain\n\nsurrogate\n\nfunction\n\n\nactivity Seq\n\n**Fig. 1 | Overview of PG.** **a, Comparison of diffusion in sequence and structure**\nspace. PG and RFdiffusion take as input noised sequence (PG) or structure\n(RFdiffusion) data and problem specific sequence and structure constraints.\nAt each denoising step, the RoseTTAFold architecture generates complete\nprotein sequences and structures, and this is used to generate the next step\nin the trajectory in sequence (PG) or structure (RFdiffusion) space. Although\nspecific structural or sequence features can be fixed in the input to RoseTTAFold\nin both approaches, biases toward particular sequence features during the\ndiffusion update at each step are more readily incorporated in PG (as are biases\ntoward structural features, such as symmetry, in RFDiffusion). b, Schematic\nof PG inference trajectory.

Of these,\n27 repeats with caps and 10 repeats without helical caps were soluble\nand monomeric by SEC, and seven of eight proteins evaluated using\ncircular dichroism had the expected secondary structure (Fig. 3b and\nSupplementary Fig. 17). We solved the crystal structure of a five-repeat\nunit design composed of a four-helix bundle asymmetric unit and found\nthe design to have atomic accuracy: the C RMSD of design to the crystal\nstructure was 1.38 \u212b for the whole structure and 0.47 \u212b for the asymmetric unit (Fig 3c and Table 1)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Table 1 | Data collection and refinement statistics for the repeat protein crystal structure\n\n**[CAP repeat (PDB: 8VD6)](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8VD6/pdb)**\n\nResolution range 72.08\u20133.70 (4.05\u20133.70)\n\nSpace group _P21_\n\n21.62, 45.05, 72.11\n\nUnit cell\n\n90.00, 91.55, 90.00\n\nUnique reflections 1,543 (359)\n\nMultiplicity 2.0 (2.0)\n\nCompleteness (%) 99.8 (99.7)\n\nMean I/sigma(I) 11.6 (7.6)\n\nWilson B-factor 76.23\n\nR-merge 0.047 (0.093)\n\nCC1/2 0.997 (0.974)\n\nReflections used in refinement 1,534 (359)\n\nReflections used for R-free 79 (79)\n\nR-work 0.2465 (0.2465)\n\nR-free 0.2847 (0.2847)\n\nNumber of non-hydrogen atoms 1,384\n\nMacromolecules 1,384\n\nProtein residues 174\n\nRMS (bonds) 0.002\n\nRMS (angles) 0.59\n\nRamachandran favored (%) 88.95\n\nRamachandran allowed (%) 7.56\n\nRamachandran outliers (%) 3.49\n\nAverage B-factor 62.38\n\nmacromolecules 62.387\n\nStatistics for the highest-resolution shell are shown in parentheses.\n\n##### Design of conditionally active peptide cages for membrane lysis\nThe design of proteins with activities conditional on an external input\nis of considerable interest for the design of therapeutics and biosensors with spatial and temporal control. We used PG to address\nthis challenge by scaffolding bioactive peptide sequences within an\ninert protein cage (Fig. 4a) by designating a region of the protein chain\n(usually at the N or C terminus) to be fixed at the bioactive peptide\nsequence and freely diffusing the remainder of the sequence. Unlike\nthe previous LOCKR[,] sensor system, in which the bioactive sequence\nmust be in a helical conformation and make specific interactions with\nthe caging scaffold, neither the structure the peptide adopts nor the\nstructure of the scaffold needs to be pre-specified, enabling caging\nof a much broader range of peptide sequences (Fig. 4b). Given the\npeptide sequence and scaffold length, PG generates designs that contain the peptide sequence as an integral part of the protein structure\nand are predicted to fold with greater than 85 pLDDT and less than\n2-\u00c5 RMSD to the designed scaffold (Fig. 4c). We used this approach to\ndesign proteins caging the pore-forming peptide melittin that can be\nconditionally released upon proteolytic cleavage of a terminal loop.\nWe specified the sequence of the bioactive peptide melittin with an\nadjacent furin cleavage site and used secondary structure conditioning to scaffold the peptide in a helical bundle with the cleavage site in a\nloop to improve protease access (Fig. 4b). Because of the multiple constraints(scaffoldingthemelittinsequenceinanorderedstructureand\n\n\na furin cleavage sequence in a loop), this required increased sampling\nand filtering (Supplementary Table 1). Despite melittin being disordered in isolation, PG was able to generate solutions with the melittin\nsequence adopting a helical structure, which we then experimentally\ntested. Of 13 experimentally characterized designs, five were soluble\nand monodisperse by SEC, folded with helical secondary structure by\nCD and thermostable (Fig. 4e,f). We extended the cleavage loop and\ninserted interface arginine mutations to promote disassociation of\nthe peptide after cleavage (Fig. 4f). Upon addition of furin protease,\na band shift from \u221218 kD to \u221215 kD indicated cleavage of our designed\nmelittin cage (Fig. 4g). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed release\nof intact melittin peptide (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 18). To test\nconditional membrane lysis of our caged melittin protein, we incubated\nred blood cells (RBCs) with design D12 in the presence or absence of\nfurin protease and measured absorbance at 450 nm to quantify the\npresence of heme from lysed RBCs. Samples pre-incubated with furin\nprotease were bright red in color, indicating membrane lysis, whereas\nlittle lysis was observed without furin before treatment (Fig. 4l and\nSupplementary Fig. 19). Due to the bioavailability of endogenous endosomal proteases, such as furin, we anticipate that the design of caged\npeptides will enable a route toward endosomal escape.\n\n##### Scaffolding barcode peptide sequences\nPeptide barcoding enables large libraries of proteins to be screened\nin binding assays or SEC, with the identity of individual proteins subsequently read out by mass spectrometry of the barcode after release\nby proteolysis. Because of the challenge of incorporating a barcode\nwithin a folded protein, current approaches attach peptide barcodes to\nproteins of interest through N-terminal or C-terminal flexible fusions,\nbut these can affect both expression and solubility, and, hence, it can\nrequire some 5\u201310 degenerate barcodes to infer the behavior of the\nuntagged protein. Given the promising results of our bioactive peptide scaffolding experiments, we reasoned that PG could scaffold\nshort barcode-like sequences (7\u201314 residues) into a protein of interest, thereby removing the need for multiple extrinsic barcodes. We\nscaffolded a set of validated peptide barcodes[,][,] at the C-terminus,\nflanked by lysine and arginine on the N-termini and C-termini, respectively, to permit facile tandem cleavage with Lys-C and trypsin. PG\ngenerates designs that contain the peptide sequence as an integral part\nof the protein structure and are predicted to fold with reasonable AF2\nconfidence and RMSD to the design (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 20).\nWe cloned, expressed and purified a pilot library of 84 pooled designs\nand used SEC to separate them by size. Barcodes were isolated from\neach fraction and run on an Orbitrap Lumos to determine the identities\nof the proteins in each fraction, as described previously[,][,]. As a control, we expressed and purified each of these 84 proteins and subjected\nthem to SEC; of these, 64 of 84 (76%) were expressed, and 48 of 64 (75%)\nof the expressed proteins exhibited monodisperse elution peaks at\nthe expected elution volume (Supplementary Fig. 21a). We overlaid\nindividual SEC (iSEC) elution profiles of expressing designs with corresponding reconstructed iSEC barcode traces (73/84) normalized to\nmaximum MS2 intensity (SEC-MS) for a set of 58 designs. We observed\nclose agreement between SEC-MS and iSEC peak elution volume for\n41 of 58 (71%) designs (Supplementary Fig. 21b); exemplary traces are\nshown in Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 22. Thus, PG can incorporate\nintrinsic barcodes into protein libraries, resulting in shorter constructs\nthan required with external barcoding approaches.\n\n##### Multistate design\nDesigning an amino acid sequence that can adopt distinct structural\nconformations upon an external trigger is a challenging task, as the\nenergy landscape must contain two discrete minima with free energy\ndifferences small enough for a trigger to induce state switching. We\nreasoned that PG was well equipped for explicit multistate design\nbecauseguidancecanbeappliedfrommultiplecondition-dependent\n\n\n-----\n\n##### a b\n\n\nDiffused\n\n\nCleavage\n\n\nBio-active\n\n\nPeptide functions\n\n\nLysis\nBarcoding\nProtease TransportationImmune response\n\n|region site peptide Protein Generator Secondary structure conditioning|Protein|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n##### c d e\n\n1.0 Individual SEC\n\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n\nRetention volume (ml)\n\n25\u00b0C\n95\u00b0C\n25\u00b0C cool\n\n200 220 240\n\n\n0\n\n100\n\n90\n80\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n\nDesign\nAF2\nPeptide\n\n1.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17\n\nRetention volume (ml)\n\nIndividual SEC\nBarcode SEC\nPooled\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17\n\nRetention volume (ml)\n\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\n10 15 20\n\n\n10 15 20\n\nRetention volume (ml)\n\n\n200 220 240\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\n\nIndividual SEC\nBarcode SEC\nPooled\n\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17\n\nRetention volume (ml)\n\n##### f g h\n\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\nComponent\n\nUncleaved\n\nCleaved\n\nMelittin\n\n\nDesign AF2 Peptide\n\nCleavage site\n\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n|ompone|nt Expected mass (Da) O|bserved peak (Da)|\n|---|---|---|\n|ncleave Cleaved Melittin|d 18,531 15,558 2,992|18,531 15,557 2,992|\n\n\n##### i\n\n\nConditional hemolysis\n\n\n0\n\n\n10 15 20\n\nRetention volume (ml)\n\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n\n250 kD\n\n150\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n37\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\n**Fig. 4 | Scaffolding bioactive peptides and intrinsic barcodes with PG.**\n**a, Schematic overview of functional peptide scaffolding for downstream tasks**\nsuch as protease cleavage for lysis and peptide barcoding. b, Sequence-only\nmotif scaffolding and secondary structure conditioning to generate proteins\nwith embedded functional sequences.

DSSP features are appended to the L\u00d720\nsequence representation of each family member to enable conditioning on protein secondary structure (Fig. 5b). We used this approach\nto generate multistate sequences (MS) that are designed to adopt\nspecific \u0251/( folds in the parent state and different all \u0251-helical folds in\nthe child states; as expected given the greater problem complexity,\nthis required more sampling than the above single sequence design\nproblems (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nWe experimentally characterized 72 parent\u2013child triples that AF2\n\npredicted with high confidence and accuracy to be in the parent state\nwhen intact and the child states when split (Supplementary Fig. 23),\nand we selected 4 (MS1\u2013MS4) soluble and monodisperse sequence\nfamilies for detailed CD and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies (Supplementary Fig. 24a\u2013d). 2D H-N amide heteronuclear single\nquantum coherence (HSQC) spectra revealed that all the MS1\u2013MS4\nparents and children were well folded and globular proteins (Supplementary Fig. 24). CD spectra of all of the children were consistent with\nall-alphaproteins;spectraldeconvolutionsuggestedhigherbeta-sheet\n\n\ncontent in the parents (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 24, middle\nrows). As secondary structure estimation by CD can be imperfect, we\ntook advantage of the fact that NMR chemical shifts are influenced by\nlocal secondary structure, which leads to distinct averaged chemical\nshift (ACS) values for primarily \u03b1-helical versus (-sheet proteins[,]. As\nexpected for proteins with increased (-character, H and N ACS values\nof all parent designs were shifted downfield relative to the two associated children (Fig. 5d, dotted yellow arrow), which were shifted upfield\ninto the reference region associated with \u03b1-helical proteins (Fig. 5d,\ndotted red arrow). Clear differences in chemical shift positions of\nMS1\u2013MS3 child A and child B NMR peaks relative to the parent suggest\nthat they adopt distinct folds (Fig. 5e,f; the differences were smaller\nfor MS4 (Supplementary Fig. 24d), which the ACS values (Fig. 5d) and\nAF2 predictions (Supplementary Fig. 24e) suggest may not adopt a\nsingle fold). Taken together, these data suggest that, as intended, the\ndesigned child sequences fold into \u0251-helical supersecondary structures\ndistinct from the parent designs.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of the designed alpha/beta parent folds,\n\nwe obtained high-resolution structures of MS2 parent and MS3 parent (Fig. 5e,f and Table 2). The solution NMR structure of MS2 parent is within 1.06 \u00c5 C\u03b1 RMSD of the design model, with the central\nbeta-sheet nearly perfectly recapitulated. The solution NMR structure\nof MS3 parent is within 1.61 \u00c5 C\u03b1 RMSD of the design model, with the\nbeta-sheet again very close to the design model. These high-resolution\nstructures of the parents, together with the all-alpha helical ACS values\nand CD spectra of the children, strongly suggest that, as designed,\nthere are large-scale structural rearrangements upon splitting of the\npolypeptide chain.\n\n##### Guidance with experimental data\nA longstanding goal in directed evolution is the optimization of desired\nfunctional attributes, such as enzyme activity, in as few experimental\niterations as possible. We investigated the use of PG for experimental data-driven protein function optimization. As a test case, we used\nan experimental benchmark dataset on the IgG-binding protein GB1,\nwhich has the advantage of completeness: activity was measured for\nevery sequence combination (for the four residues that were varied),\nallowing for evaluation of the activity of any sequence generated for\nthese residues using PG. For other datasets where only a small fraction\nof sequences have known fitness, it is difficult to do such retrospective comparisons (because the PG-generated sequences will almost\nalways have unknown fitness, like the vast majority of other possible\nsequences).\n\nWe simulated an iterative guidance process by exploring the fit\nness landscape of the protein GB1 via gradient-based optimization\nwith IgG binding activity-guided diffusion trajectories. At each step,\nwe biased sampling by gradients from classifiers trained on the experimentally determined fitnesses of preceding rounds (Fig. 1c). As the\nclassifiers, we used two-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) optimized\nfor GB1 fitness greater than 2. For broad applicability, we carried out\nthis optimization with standard settings and no extensive hyperparameter turning (96 designs generated and tested per round for three\nrounds). For comparison, we tested multiple optimization approaches\nusing different acquisition functions on this same problem and chose\nthe best performer to compare to PG. We found that the average and\nmaximum fitness of PG-generated designs increases each round, outperforming a Bayesian optimization baseline with the best identified\nacquisition function (batched upper confidence bound) (Fig. 1d and\nSupplementary Figs. 25 and 26). The improved performance likely\nreflects the rich prior understanding of protein sequence\u2013structure\nrelationships implicit in RoseTTAFold compared to the baseline, which\nhas access to only limited experimental data. Our PG approach can\nreadily incorporate any experimentally measurable fitness attribute\nand should be useful for machine-learning-assisted directed evolution\ncampaigns[\u2013]\n\n\n-----\n\n### Discussion\nThe in silico and experimental results presented here demonstrate\nthat PG can readily generate a wide variety of de novo (Supplementary Fig. 27) proteins subject to diverse sequence domain constraints,\nincluding amino acid composition bias, repeat sequence symmetry,\nbioactive peptide caging and multistate design. In this section, we\ncompare PG to RFdiffusion and highlight the areas where PG sequence\nspace diffusion is particularly advantageous. Both PG and RFdiffusion\ntake advantage of RoseTTAFold to jointly model protein sequences and\nstructures, and, hence, both PG sequence space diffusion trajectories\nand RFdiffusion structure space diffusion trajectories can be guided\nby both sequence and structure information. For example, given \u2018hard\nconstraints\u2019, such as the identities of amino acids at certain positions,\nor the 3D structure of part of a protein (for an enzyme active site, typically both types of constraints would be provided), both methods will\ngenerate proteins satisfying the constraints by providing the relevant\nsequence and structure input at each RoseTTAFold denoising step along\nwith the current partially denoised sequence (PG) or structure (RFdiffusion). However, \u2018softer\u2019 sequence constraints, such as biases on the\nnumber of amino acids of a given type, are more readily implemented in\nsequence space diffusion, whereas global structural properties, such as\noverall symmetry, are more readily implemented in structure-based diffusion. As with other protein generative models, obtaining sequences\npredicted to satisfy specific problem constraints required considerable\nfiltering; future work will seek to increase the fraction of generated\nsequences that are confidently predicted.\n\nSequence space diffusion is specifically advantageous in multi\nstate design of protein sequences that fold to two or more distinct\nstructures as in our parent child designs; this can be implemented in\nsequence space diffusion by logit averaging, but it is not straightforward with structure space diffusion. PG enables deep-learning-based\nmultistate design through the joint search of sequence and structure space without assuming fixed structural priors and should be\nreadily generalizable to the design of more complex conditional\nstate-switching protein systems; evaluation of these designs will benefit from advances in methods for structure ensemble prediction[\u2013].\nBeyond multistate design, we expect PG, and, more broadly, generative\nmethods enabling direct sequence based guidance, to be useful in generating successive rounds of sequences for experimental characterization in directed evolution campaigns[,]. Although classifiers trained\non the available experimental data can be used to directly generate\nsequences using Bayesian optimization and other approaches, using\nthese classifiers instead to guide PG diffusion trajectories has the considerable advantage of being informed by the rich sequence\u2013structure\nprior information represented within the PG network, which increases\nthe likelihood that the generated sequences will fold and function.\n\n### Online content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information,\nacknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code avail[ability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-024-02395-w.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-024-02395-w)\n\n### References\n1.

To implement this, we represented the sequence, x0, with dimensions L\u00d720\nwhere L corresponds to the protein length with 20 possibilities for each\namino acid type. This takes the form of a one-hot encoded vector that\nis centered at zero by multiplying the L\u00d720 tensor by 2 and subtracting 1. Each logit within the tensor is a real number, with higher values\ncorresponding to a higher probability for that specific amino acid at\nthat position. With this representation, we noise x0 to obtain xt with\nthe below equation following the Ho et al. formulation for a standard\nforward process sampling from Gaussian noise with mean at 0 and\nstandard deviation of 1.\n\n_q(xt|x0) = \ud835\udca9\ud835\udca9(xt; \u221a\u0304\u03b1tx0, (1 \u2212_ _\u03b1\u0304t)I)_\n\nA critical part of the forward diffusion process is selecting the noising\nschedule. Determining the correct bin of a categorical distribution is\ntrivial at low timesteps by argmaxing the input sequence. Therefore,\nmore noise should be present at low timesteps to increase the difficulty\nof the task during training. The square root noise schedule satisfies\nthis requirement and was employed in this study.\n\n##### Training\nTo train the model, we began by sampling t uniformly from [0,T], where\n_t = 0 is an un-noised sequence and t = T is pure Gaussian noise. We then_\nnoise x0 to xt with equation (1) and tasked the model to predict the\nun-noised sequence x0 and its corresponding structure y. The timestep\nfeature was added to the sequence template passed to the model. We\napplied a categorical cross-entropy loss to x0 and structure losses to\n**y (FAPE, bond angle, bond length, distogram, lddt). An additional KL**\nloss was applied to the calculated xt\u22121, as previously demonstrated to\nstabilize training of discrete diffusion models. Self-conditioning was\nimplemented to allow the model to condition on the previous x0 prediction and the back-calculated xt\u22121 during both training and inference. To\nself-condition in practice, the model was used with gradients turned\noff to first predict x0 from xt+1, which was then passed in as a sequence\ntemplate to the model. During training, RoseTTAFold was allowed 1\u20133\nuniformly sampled \u2018recycle\u2019 steps to refine structure predictions via\nmultiple passes through the model. Pseudo training and inference\ncode is available in the Supplementary Information (Algorithms S1 and\nS2). In later training iterations, secondary structure conditioning was\nprovided to the model by concatenating a tensor representing DSSP\nfeatures onto the sequence template. These features were provided 25%\nof the time and masked uniformly between 0% and 90% when provided.\n\nAlong with the standard diffusion task (40% of the time), the model\n\nwas also challenged with structure prediction (seq2str) and fixed backbone sequence design (30% of the time each). Incorporating these\nadditional tasks during training helped maintain the agreement of\nsequence\u2013structure pairs diffused by the model. Training examples\nwere conditioned on sequence or structure by either unmasking 1\u20134\nspans of residues, each 4\u20138 amino acids in length to simulate motif\nscaffolding, or unmasking randomly selected residues for the model\nto scaffold as an active site scaffolding problem. Unmasked structure\nconditioning information was supplied to the input for RoseTTAFold\nas templates in the 1D sequence track as well as the 2D and 3D structural\ninformation tracks.\n\n##### Inference\nDuring inference starting from xt, the model predicts x0 and simultaneously decodes it to y. x0 is then back-calculated to xt\u22121 with equation\n(1) and passed through the network with the previously predicted x0\nto apply self-conditioning. Benchmarking against conditioning on xt,\nasdoneinHoetal  withthebelowequation showsthatthisapproach\n\n\nperforms better (Supplementary Fig. 3c), as seen in other categorical\ndiffusion methods[,].\n\n_q(xt\u22121|xt, x0) = \ud835\udca9\ud835\udca9(xt\u22121;_ _\u03bc\u03bc\u03bct\u0303_ (xt, x0), \u03b2t[\u0303] **I),**\n\nwhere _\u03bc\u03bc\u03bct\u0303_ (xt, x0) \u2236= \u221a\u03041\u03b1\u2212\u0304t\u2212\u03b11t\u03b2t **[x][ +][ \u221a][\u03b1][t]1[(]\u2212\u0304[\u2212\u0304]\u03b1[\u03b1]t** _[t][\u2212][)]_ **xt and** _\u03b2t[\u0303]_ \u2236= 1\u2212\u03041\u2212\u0304\u03b1\u03b1t\u2212t 1 _[\u03b2][t]_\n\nThis is done for T steps, but T can be varied and does not have to be\n\nwhat was used during training (inference time for fixed T can be found\nin Supplementary Table 2). The model finds solutions to some problems in as few as 10 steps (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, clamping the model\u2019s\noutput logits from \u22123,3 gives better agreement with AF2 predictions\n(Supplementary Fig. 3b). xt\u22121 is sampled from either a zero-mean normal\ndistribution or a non-Bayesian Gaussian mixture distribution with equal\nmixing probabilities. For the non-Bayesian Gaussian mixture models,\nwe defined a mixture with two normals centered at [\u22121, 1] (GMM2) and\na mixture with three normals centered at [\u22121, 0, 1] (GMM3).\n\n##### Unconditional protein generation\nUnconditionally generated proteins were assessed against a set of\n1,000 native proteins with a length deviating up to five residues randomly sampled from the RCSB database. For experimental verification, proteins ranging from 70 to 80 amino acids in length with no\nconditioning information were generated in 25 steps. Designs were\nfiltered by AF2 pLDDT > 90 and AF2 RMSD to design < 2 \u00c5 for ordering\nfinal constructs. Additionally, proteins with high model confidence\nbut moderate AF2 confidence were ordered by filtering on design\npLDDT > 90, AF2 pLDDT < 80 and AF2 RMSD to design < 5 \u00c5.\n\n##### Compositionally biased protein generation\nProteins ranging from 70 to 80 amino acids in length with an amino\nacid compositional potential were generated in 25 steps. Designs\nwere filtered by AF2 pLDDT > 90, AF2 RMSD to design < 2 \u00c5 and SAP\nscore < 30. The top 10\u201322 designs were ordered for each upweighted\namino acid type (tryptophan, cysteine, valine, histidine and methionine). Pseudocode for the implementation of the amino acid compositional potential is provided in the supplements (Algorithm S3).\n\n##### Charge biased protein generation\nProteins of 50 amino acids in length with charge potentials applied\nwere generated in 25 steps with charge conditioning information. The\nground truth charge for each protein was calculated at pH 7.4 by using\nthe Henderson\u2013Hasselbach equation.\n\n##### Hydrophobic biased protein generation\nProteins of 50 amino acids in length with hydrophobic potentials\napplied were generated in 25 steps with hydrophobicity conditioning\ninformation. The ground truth hydropathy index for each design was\ncalculated by summing the hydropathy index for each residue and\ndividing by the sequence length.\n\n##### DSSP guidance\nFor constructing the DSSP features, we calculated each training example\u2019s DSSP based on the structure with helix, strand, loop and masked\nlabels. During training, the calculated per-residue secondary structure features were appended to RoseTTAFold\u2019s 1D features and were\none-hot encoded for 25% or 50% of the time and masked for 30% or\n80% of the time. During inference, DSSP features are appended to the\n1D features as necessary and masked when not. Secondary structure\nrepresentations were input to the model as follows: H, helix; E, sheet;\nL, loop; X, masked.\n\n##### Repeat protein generation\nRepeat proteins ranging from 125 to 150 amino acids in length were\ngenerated in 50 steps with and without DSSP conditioning information Designed proteins contained five repeat units using one of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe following DSSP strings, where X represents mask, E represents\nstrand and H represents helix:\u2018XXXXEEEEEXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXHHHHHXXXX\u2019, \u2018XXXXEEEEEXXXXXHHHHHXXXXXEEEEEXXXX\u2019,\n\u2018XXXXHHHHHXXXXXEEEEEXXXXXHHHHHXXXX\u2019, \u2018XXXXHHHHHXXLXXHHHHHXXLXXHHHHHXXXX\u2019, \u2018XXXXEEEEEXXHXXEEEEEXXHXXEEEEEXXXX\u2019, \u2018XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u2019,\n\u2018XXXXEXXXXXXXXXEXXXXXXXXXEXXXXXXXX\u2019. Designs were filtered\non AF2 pLDDT > 80 and AF2 RMSD to design < 2 \u00c5.\n\n##### Caging bioactive peptides\nProteins of 155 amino acids in length were generated in 25 steps with\nspans of helical DSSP conditioning to encourage the model to generate\nhelical bundles and cleavage loops. Additional DSSP features were provided to scaffold the furin protease cleavage site \u2018GRRKR\u2019. The sequence\nfor melittin was provided without DSSP conditioning as N-terminal 26\namino acids \u2018GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ\u2019. Designs were filtered\nby AF2 pLDDT > 85, AF2 RMSD to design < 2 \u00c5 and SAP scores < 40.\n\n##### Scaffolding barcode peptide sequences\nProteins of 100 amino acids in length were generated in 50 steps with\nbarcodes being set as fixed regions on the C-terminus. Designs were\nfiltered by AF2 pLDDT > 85 and AF2 RMSD to design < 2 \u00c5.\n\n##### Multistate guidance\nParent and child protein pairings were generated in 25 steps using\nsecondary structure features \u2018XHHHHHHHHHHHHHLLLHHHHHH\nHHHHHHHLLLEEEEEELLLEEEEEXXXXXXXEEEEELLLE EEEEELLLH\nHHHHHHHHHHHHLLLHHHHHHHHHHHHHX\u2019 for parent, \u2018XHHHH\nHHHHHHHHHLLLHHHHHHHHHHHHHLLLHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHX\u2019 for child A and \u2018XHHHHHHHHHHHHHHLLLHHHHHHHHHHHHHLLLHHHHHHHHHHHHHX\u2019 for child B. A mixing coefficient\nof 0.25 was used to combine parent and child sequences together at\neach step. Multistate design pseudocode implementation is available\nin the supplements (Algorithm S4).\n\n##### Partial noising\nTo promote further exploration of known active sequence subspaces,\nwe implemented partial noising during design trajectories. This was\ndone by introducing a temperature parameter, * \u2208 (0 to 1], to PG that,\nat the beginning of a trajectory, sets t to round (T**) rather than T\n(complete noising). This forced the model to do local exploration of\nthe partially noisy sequence subpace. This approach was done in conjunction with normal design trajectories in \u2018multistate guidance\u2019 with\n\n- parameters iterated through [0.2,0.3,0.5,0.8] starting with passing\nAF2 design sequences.\n\n##### Iterative guidance\nIterative guidance was employed as described in Fig. 1c. In short, the\nexperimental or in silico characterization of designs is collected to\ntrain a classifier, which is used to generate further designs with guidance. In an iterative process, classifiers trained on designs sampled\nin a preceding round inform network sampling. We investigated the\nnearly complete fitness landscape of the V39, D40, G41 and V54 amino\nacid sites of GB1, which is the binding domain of protein G, an immunoglobulin binding protein found in streptococcal bacteria, as provided\nin the FLIP paper. Three rounds of iterative design were conducted\nwith a batch size of 96.\n\nWe performed diffusion on the four mutation sites in the GB1 pro\ntein while providing guidance using a scale of 2.0 in the second-round\nand third-round design processes. In the first round, designs are\ndirectly sampled from our protein generator. For each round, a vanilla\nMLP (two layers, rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation and dropout\nof 0.25 after the first layer) is trained on the designs generated in the\npreceding round using a fitness equal to 1 as the classifier boundary For comparison batched Bayesian optimization was performed\n\n\nfor three rounds using the sequences generated in the first round\nof the iterative guidance as the initial dataset. For Bayesian optimization, we used Gaussian processes with the radial basis function (RBF)\nkernel for the surrogate function, and we used the Monte Carlo\u2013based\nbatch upper confidence bound (qUCB) acquisition function with\n\n- = 0.5.\n\n##### Sequence and structure quality metrics\nAll designs used in the ESMFold benchmarks were modeled by using\n[the following curl command: [curl -X POST\u2013data \u2018SEQUENCE\u2019] (https://](https://api.esmatlas.com/foldSequence/v1/pdb/)\n[api.esmatlas.com/foldSequence/v1/pdb/). All designs that were used](https://api.esmatlas.com/foldSequence/v1/pdb/)\nin AF2 benchmarks and ordered for experimental characterization\nwere predicted in single-sequence structure prediction mode with\nmodel 4. Pairwise backbone RMSDs between the design model and\nAF2 model were calculated for each design. Sequence quality metrics\nmeasured by ESM (pseudo) perplexity were calculated with model:\nesm2_t33_650M_UR50D.\n\n##### Sequence identity calculations\nBlast alignment was used to examine sequence alignment and similarity\nusing query coverage >90% and target coverage >50%. Alignment to\nnatives was done against UniRef90 (Supplementary Fig. 27).\n\n##### Plasmid construction\nProtein designs were cloned into plasmids as in Watson et al.. In brief,\ndesigns were ordered as synthetic genes (eBlocks, Integrated DNA\nTechnologies) with BsaI overhangs compatible with a ccdB-encoding\nexpression vector, LM0627 (ref. 7). Genes cloned into LM0627 result\nin the following sequence: MSG-design-GSGSHHWGSTHHHHHH\n(SNAC cleavage tag and 6\u00d7His affinity tag are indicated). We used\nthe NEBridge Golden Gate Assembly Kit (New England Biolabs) with\na total reaction volume of 5 \u00b5l and a ratio of 1:2 by mass of LM0627\nplasmid DNA to design. We then incubated the reaction mixture at 37 C\nfor 30 min, halted the reaction by incubating the reaction mixture at\n60 \u00b0C for 5 min and transformed 1 \u00b5l of the reaction mixture into 6 \u00b5l\nof BL21 competent cells (New England Biolabs). After heat shock and\nrecovery in SOC media, transformed BL21 cells were grown overnight\nin 1.0 ml of LB from which glycerol stock was created and small-scale\nexpression cultures were inoculated.\n\n##### 1-ml-scale protein purification\nInitially, proteins were expressed with small-scale expression screens as\npreviously reported with small adaptations. In brief, designs were inoculated with 100 \u00b5l of overnight growths and 900 \u00b5l of auto-induction\nmedia (sterile-filtered TBII media supplemented with 50 \u00b5g ml[\u22121] kanamycin, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 \u00d7 5,052) in deep-well 96-well plates. Sixteen\nhours after inoculation, cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer\n(50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole supplemented\nwith 1\u00d7 BugBuster, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mg ml[\u22121] lysozyme, 0.1 mg ml[\u22121]\nDNase). Clarified lysates were added to a 50-\u00b5l bed of Ni-NTA agarose\nresin in a 96-well fritted plate equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole). After sample application and flowthrough, the resin was washed three times with wash\nbuffer, and samples were eluted in 200 \u00b5l of elution buffer (50 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 8), 0.3 M NaCl, 0.5 M imidazole, 5 mM EDTA (pH 8)). All\neluates were sterile filtered with a 96-well 0.22-\u00b5m filter plate (Agilent,\n203940-100) before SEC. Protein designs were then screened via SEC\nusing an \u00c4KTA FPLC outfitted with an autosampler capable of running\nsamples from a 96-well source plate. Samples were run on a Superdex\nS75 Increase 5/150 GL column (Cytiva, 29148722; 3,000\u201370,000-Da\nseparation range) in a running buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl).\nTo improve peak resolution, the SEC column was connected directly in\nline from the autosampler to the UV detector. Then, 0.25-ml fractions\nwere collected from each run. Absorption spectra were collected by\nan\u00c4KTAU9-Mat230 nmand280 nm\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 50-ml-scale protein purification\nProteins selected for further downstream characterization were\nexpressed in 50 ml of auto-induction media. Sixteen hours after\ninoculation, cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mg ml[\u22121]\nlysozyme, 0.1 mg ml[\u22121] DNase) through sonication. Clarified lysates were\nadded to a 2-ml bed of Ni-NTA agarose resin in a 20-ml column (Bio-Rad,\n7321010) equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M\nNaCl, 30 mM imidazole). After sample application and flowthrough, the\nresin was washed three times with 10 ml of wash buffer, and samples\nwere eluted in 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl,\n200 mM imidazole). All eluates were sterile filtered with a 3-ml 0.22-\u00b5m\nfilter plate before SEC. Protein designs were then screened via SEC\nusing an \u00c4KTA FPLC outfitted with an autosampler capable of running\nsamples from a 96-well source plate. Samples were run on a Superdex\nS75 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva, 29148721; 3,000\u201370,000-Da\nseparation range) in a running buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl).\nThen, 1-ml fractions were collected from each run. Absorption spectra\nwere collected by the \u00c4KTA U9-M at 230 nm and 280 nm.\n\n##### 0.5-L-scale protein purification and SNAC cleavage\nThe best expressing proteins used in high-resolution structural studies were selected for further scale-up and SNAC cleavage. Proteins\nwere expressed in Studiers M2 autoinduction media with 50 \u00b5g ml[\u22121]\nkanamycin. Pre-cultures were grown overnight. Cultures were inoculated with 10 ml of pre-culture and grown at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h before lowering\ntemperature to 22 \u00b0C for 14 h, and cultures were inoculated with 10 ml\nof pre-culture. Cells were pelleted at 4,000g for 10 min, after which the\nsupernatant was discarded. Pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis\nbuffer (100 mM Tris HC (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl, 400 mM imidazole, 1 mM\nPMSF, 1 mM DNase). Cell suspensions were lysed by sonication for 7.5 min\n(10 s on, 10 s off) at 80% amplitude using a Qsonica four-prong sonicator.\nThe lysate was clarified at 14,000g for 30 min. The His-tagged proteins\nwere batch bound for 1 h to 8 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and washed\nwith 10 ml of lysis buffer and 30 ml of high-salt wash buffer (25 mM Tris\nHCl (pH 8), 1 M NaCl, 40 mM imidazole) and then 10 ml of SNAC cleavage\nbuffer (100 mM CHES, 100 mM acetone oxime, 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM\nGnCl (pH 8.6)). Next, 40 ml of SNAC cleavage buffer and 80 \u00b5l of 1 M NiCl2\nwere added, and columns were closed and shaken on a nutator for 12 h to\ncleave. After cleavage, the flowthrough was collected and concentrated\nbefore further purification by SEC/FPLC as described above.\n\n##### Cysteine bias protein expression\nProteins guided toward high cysteine content were transformed into\nand expressed in Rosetta-gami B(DE3) competent cells (Novagen,\n71137). The 1-ml and 50-ml scale protein purification protocols were\notherwise followed.\n\n##### CD\nCD spectra were collected on a Jasco J-1500 CD spectrometer with 1-nm\nbandwidth, 50-nm permanent scan rate and data integration time of 4 s\nper read. Sample cuvettes stored in 2% Hellmanex (Hellma, 9-307-011-4507) were washed with deionized water, 2% Hellmanex, deionized water\nand then 20% ethanol, after which 300 \u00b5l of SEC-purified protein was\nadded for CD spectra measurements. Thermal melts were performed\nin 10\u00b0 intervals between 25 \u00b0C and 95 \u00b0C.\n\n##### Mass spectrometry\nTo identify the molecular mass of each protein, intact mass spectra were\nobtained via reverse-phase liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\n(LC\u2013MS) on an Agilent G6230B TOF on an AdvanceBio RP-Desalting column and subsequently deconvoluted by way of BioConfirm using a total\nentropy algorithm. Disulfide formation was determined by injecting\nprotein at 1.5 mg ml[\u22121] in the presence and absence of 50 mM TCEP-HCl\n(Millipore Sigma 646547-10X1ML) and detecting the massshift\n\n\n##### Disulfide bond quantification\nTo measure the number of cysteines via alkylation, proteins at\n1.5 mg ml[\u22121] in SEC running buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl)\nwere incubated in 50 mM TCEP-HCl at 50 \u00b0C for 1 h to reduce disulfide\nbonds. Simultaneously, an equal amount of protein in SEC running\nbuffer was heated to 50 \u00b0C without 10 mM TCEP to maintain formed\ndisulfides. Iodoacetamide (Millipore Sigma, I1149) was added to both\nconditions to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated away from\nlight at room temperature for 30 min to alkylate unpaired cysteines.\nTo identify the molecular mass and alkylations status of each protein, intact mass spectra were obtained via reverse-phase LC\u2013MS on\nthe Agilent G6230B TOF on an AdvanceBio RP-Desalting column and\nsubsequently deconvoluted by way of BioConfirm using a total entropy\nalgorithm.\n\n##### Barcode extraction and liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry\nNi-NTA eluate of the 84-design pool was subjected to SEC with deep\nfractionation (0.25-ml fractions). From every other fraction, 100 \u00b5l was\nadded to fresh wells in a 96-well plate, and fractions were subjected to\ncleavage in 100 \u00b5l of Lys-C buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM Tris HCl (pH 8))\nplus 1 \u00b5g of endoproteinase LysC (New England Biolabs, P8109S), as\npreviously described. After hexaHis-tagged barcode pulldown with\nmagnetic His-pulldown beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10103D)\nand subsequent trypsin (New England Biolabs, P8101S) digest to free\nbarcodes, barcodes were diluted 50% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).\nBarcode pools corresponding to SEC fractions were separated by\nhydrophobicity using a previously described tandem guard column\u2013\nanalytical column setup. The guard column was packed to 2 cm with\n5 \u00b5m of silica (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18Aq, ESI Source Solutions, r15.\naq.0001), whereas the analytical column was packed to 14 cm with\n1.9 \u00b5m of silica (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18Aq, ESI Source Solutions, r119.\naq.0001). Peptides were detected using a previously described data\nindependent acquisition (DIA) protocol on a Orbitrap Fusion Lumos\nTribrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the UW Proteomic Resource\n(UWPR).\n\n##### Solution NMR\nRecombinant plasmid DNA (~100 ng) containing synthetic genes\nencoding for child A, child B and parent for several design families\nwere separately transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Colonies were\ngrown under kanamycin selection on LB agar media for 16 h. Toward\npreparation of uniformly N-labeled proteins, a streak of colonies was\nresuspended in 60 ml of 1\u00d7 M9 minimal media and grown overnight\nat 37 \u00b0C/225 r.p.m., and the inoculum was used to initiate a 1-L 1\u00d7 minimal media culture supplemented with kanamycin and N ammonium\nchloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, NLM-467) as the nitrogen\nsource. For N/C-labeled proteins, C-labeled glucose (Cambridge\nIsotope Laboratories, CLM-1396) was used as the carbon source. Cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C/225 r.p.m. until the optical density at\n600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6 and then induced with 1 mM IPTG and\ngrown at 37 \u00b0C/225 r.p.m. for 6 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation (6,000g, 15 min, 4 \u00b0C), and cell pellets were resuspended with wash\nbuffer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris (pH 8)). Cells were\nlysed by sonication on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation\nat 10,000g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml\nHis-Trap Ni-NTA column. The column was washed extensively with wash\nbuffer, and protein was eluted using a linear gradient from 0% to 100%\nelution buffer (300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris (pH 8)).\nFractions containing protein were pooled and further purified by SEC\non a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in NMR buffer (100 mM\nNaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5)). All designs were purified into\nbatch-matched NMR buffer and then concentrated to 300 \u00b5l in 3-kDa\nAmicon concentrators. The purity of eluent fractions was confirmed\nto be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE Protein concentrations were\n\n\n-----\n\nmeasured by NanoDrop spectrophotometer at 280 nm with extinction\ncoefficient predicted by ExPASY ProtParam. 2D H-N amide HSQC\nspectra (Bruker pulse sequence hsqcetf3gpsi) were acquired using\nstandard parameters at a H field of 800 MHz at 37 \u00b0C with recycle delay\n(d1) set to 1.2 s, sweep width of 30 ppm and acquisition time of 60 ms\nand number of scans ranging from 8 to 64 on a Bruker AVIIIHD-800\nspectrometer equipped with a 3-mm TCI cryoprobe. All data were\nprocessed in NMRPipe and analyzed in NMRFAM-SPARKY.\n\nUniformly double-labeled N/C design proteins were prepared\n\nin NMR buffer as described above at final concentrations of 200 \u00b5M to\n1,400 \u00b5M. Backbone HN, N, C\u03b1, C13 and CO resonances were assigned\nusing sequential assignment strategies via standard triple-resonance\nexperiments with non-uniform sampling with 20% Poisson gap sam[pling schedule and were reconstructed with istHMS10 (http://gwag-](http://gwagner.med.harvard.edu/intranet/hmsIST/)\n[ner.med.harvard.edu/intranet/hmsIST/). The following experiments](http://gwagner.med.harvard.edu/intranet/hmsIST/)\nwere recorded: 3D HNCA (Bruker pulse sequence hncagpwg3d), 3D\nHNCO (Bruker pulse sequence hncogpwg3d), 3D HNCACB (Bruker\npulse sequence hncacbgpwg3d) and 3D CBCACONH (Bruker pulse\nsequence cbcaconhgpwg3d). Acquisition times were 92 ms in H, 15 ms\nin N, 20 ms in CO and 10/5 ms in C\u03b1/C13. Recycle delay was set to\n1 s in all experiments, which were recorded at a H field of 800 MHz at\n37 \u00b0C. To obtain through-space restraints for structure calculation,\n3D amide\u2013amide NOESY experiments (3D SOFAST HNHAro-NHN) were collected with 8\u201316 scans, 0.6-s recycle delay and 350-ms mixing time.\nNuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) cross-peaks were assigned manually\nin NMRFAM-SPARKY. NMR peak assignments were used by TALOS-N to\ndetermine secondary structure information, random coil index order\nparameter predictions and dihedral angle restraints toward structure\ncalculation. Structure calculations were set up with automated Python\nscripts using CS-Rosetta[,]. We first used TALOS-N to determine psi\nand phi dihedral angles, and we used protein design sequences and\nassigned chemical shift values to pick fragments of amino acid lengths\n3 and 9. We then used the protein sequence, 3mer/9mer fragments,\nbackbone chemical shifts and amide\u2013amide NOEs as input for the abrelax CS-Rosetta protocol (Rosetta version 3.8 and CS-Rosetta Toolbox\nversion 3.3). From the 30,000 decoys calculated, the 10 lowest energy\nmodels were selected to represent the final NMR ensemble structure.\nThe structure calculation was considered converged because the lowest energy models clustered within less than 2 \u212b from the model with\nthe lowest energy. Final structures were validated with MolProbity.\n\n1HN and 15N ACS values were determined from peaks in 2D 1H-15N\n\nHSQC spectra using the following equation[,]:\n\n\nACSi =  \u2211\n\n_N_ _K=1,M_\n\n\n_\u03c9k_\n\n\nwhere i = HN and N atoms; N is the total number of peaks picked in\nthe HSQC spectrum; M is the total number of residues in the protein\nsequence; and wk is the chemical shift of the k-th resonance.\n\nReference HN and N ACS values for primarily \u03b1-helical proteins\n\nand primary 13-sheet proteins were taken from previous reports by\nMielke et al.[,].\n\n##### Furin cleavage\nTo cleave designed proteins, 5 U of furin protease (New England Biolabs,\nP8077S) was combined with 30 \u00b5M design in enzyme buffer (20 mM\nHEPES, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM 13-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at\n25 \u00b0C for 16 h. Cleavage reaction was used for SDS-PAGE (Any kDTM\nMini-PROTEAN TGXTM Precast Protein Gels) with protein standards\n(Precision Plus Protein Dual Color Standards).\n\n##### Blood cell lysis assay\nHemolysis assay was performed as described previously. Single-donor\nwashed human RBCs (Innovative Research, IWB3ALS40ML) were\nwashedthreetimesbyspinningbloodat500g for5 minanddiscarding\n\n\nsupernatant until supernatant appears clear. PBS was used to resuspend the RBCs at 10% hematocrit (v/v). Blood cell lysis was carried out\nin a 96-well plate at a final hematocrit of 2.5%. Negative controls include\nPBS, cleavage buffer and cleavage buffer with 0.5 U of furin. Positive\ncontrols include 2% Triton-X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, 9036-19-5) and 15 \u00b5M\nmelittin (GenScript, RP20415). Designed proteins were diluted to\n15 \u00b5M with PBS. Washed RBCs were added to each well and incubated\nat 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, after which the reaction plate was spun down at 500g for\n5 min. Supernatant from the reaction plate was transferred to a 96-well\nclear-bottom microplate (Corning, 3598). Absorbance was measured\nat 450 nm on an Agilent BioTek Epoch 2 TSC microplate reader.\n\n##### Crystallography\nAll crystallization experiments were conducted using the sitting drop\nvapor diffusion method. Crystallization trials were set up in 200-nl\ndrops using the 96-well plate format at 20 \u00b0C.\n\nCrystallization plates were set up using a mosquito LCP from SPT\n\nLabtech and then imaged using UVEX microscopes and UVEX PS-256\nfrom JAN Scientific. Diffraction quality crystals formed in a mixture of\n0.1 M PCB buffer (pH 4) and 25% PEG 1500.\n\nDiffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light\n\nSource II. X-ray intensities and data reduction were evaluated and\nintegrated using XDS and merged/scaled using Pointless/Aimless in\nthe CCP4 program suite. Structure determination and refinement\nstarting phases were obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser\nusing the designed model for the structures. After molecular replacement, the models were improved using phenix.autobuild. Structures\nwere refined in Phenix. Model building was performed using Coot.\nThe final model was evaluated using MolProbity. Data collection and\nrefinement statistics are recorded in Table 1.

However, there is still room for improvement\nin terms of the performance of single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification and computing resource usage for the state-of-the-art\napproaches. In this work, we introduce miniSNV, a lightweight SNV calling algorithm that simultaneously achieves high performance\nand yield. miniSNV utilizes known common variants in populations as variation backgrounds and leverages read pileup, read-based\nphasing, and consensus generation to identify and genotype SNVs for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads. Benchmarks on\nreal and simulated ONT data under various error profiles demonstrate that miniSNV has superior sensitivity and comparable accuracy\non SNV detection and runs faster with outstanding scalability and lower memory than most state-of-the-art variant callers. miniSNV\nis available from [https://github.com/CuiMiao-HIT/miniSNV.](https://github.com/CuiMiao-HIT/miniSNV)\n\nKeywords: SNV calling; Oxford Nanopore technology; read-based phasing; consensus\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nSingle nucleotide variants (SNVs) are the most abundant form of\ngenomic variation which play a pivotal role in various biological\nprocesses and many diseases, and are essential to deciphering the\nrelationship between genetic composition and specific diseases\n\n. Most existing SNV calling methods are optimized for short\nreads, which encounter mapping difficulties in repetitive regions\nand result in undetected SNVs . The emergence of long-read\nsequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies\n(ONT)  and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) , has facilitated more\ncomprehensive analysis due to the longer sequencing reads .\n\n\nONT is a nanopore-based and high-throughput sequencing\n\nplatform that can generate reads greater than 100 kb ,\nwhich can easily span and map to repetitive genomic regions.\nHowever, the base accuracy of the nanopore reads is relatively\nlower than that of PacBio HiFi  and short reads mainly due\nto the higher and systematic base-level error characteristic .\nThe accuracy of ONT reads continually improves with enhancements in nanopores, sequencing chemistry, and basecalling algorithms. The latest released experimental data of ONT generated\nby R10.4.1 nanopores, kit v14 motor protein, and basecalled using\na bespoke Dorado  model was announced to yield a median\naccuracy of Q26.4 . Under these circumstances, numerous\nefforts are underway to improve the identification of small variants, which generally fall into two main categories: deep learning\n(DL) and statistical-based.\n\n\nOver the years, DL methods have dominated the era of long\nread-based variant calling , which had two major designs\ninvolving pileup or full-alignment . Pileup-based methods\nsummarized the read alignments into features before input into\na variant-calling network, and full-alignment-based methods\nkept spatial information in the read alignments. Up to now,\nthere are several DL-based tools widely used for genomic variant\ncalling. DeepVariant  tried DL for the first time and PEPPERMargin-DeepVariant  integrated full-alignment-based PEPPER,\nMargin, and DeepVariant to enhance the accuracy of variant\ncalling. Nanocaller  is pileup-based and uses a three-layer\nconvolutional neural network architecture. Clair3  first tried\ncombining pileup and full-alignment. Both PEPPER-MarginDeepVariant and Clair3 leveraged the haplotype information\nto improve variant identification . It is worth noting\nthat Clair3 is officially recommended and is integrated into\nthe official workflow for genomic analysis . As we all know,\nthere are relatively few statistical-based methods used for longread variant identification because sequencing errors bring too\nmany candidate variants to the heuristic-based candidate finder,\nlimiting the computational time and accuracy of detection.\nLongshot  is a diploid SNV calling method, utilizing a pair\nhidden Markov Model to average over the uncertainty in the\nlocal read alignments and finally determines phased genotypes\nby calculating genotype likelihoods and performing haplotype\nassembly using HapCUT2 .\n\n\n**Received:** May 14, 2024. **Revised:** June 18, 2024. **Accepted:** September 12, 2024\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.

In practice, miniSNV organizes the\nreference genome by a series of windows with fixed length\n(default: L = 300 bp) and any two adjacent windows have halflength overlap. Multiallelic loci are split into several biallelic loci\nand any alternative allele with a frequency larger than 5% is\nrecorded with a unique identity (UID) composed by window ID,\nposition, reference base, and alternative base (abbreviated as\nwid_pos_ref_alt). The window ID is calculated using the formula:\n_pos_in_genome_ \u00d7 2/L, where _pos_in_genome_ is the accumulated\nposition in the reference genome across all chromosomes.\n\n\nadvantages cannot be ignored compared to DL methods. Firstly,\nstatistical-based methods generally do not require a large\nnumber of labeled data for model training. This is especially\nimportant in studies of new species or minority population\nsamples, which lack sufficient prior knowledge and training\ndata. Secondly, statistical-based methods are designed with\ngeneralization in mind, allowing them to adapt well to different\nspecies and sequencing data. These methods are usually based\non widely applicable mathematical principles and assumptions,\nrather than specific data distribution characteristics. Thirdly,\nmany statistical learning methods are more computationally\nlightweight and faster compared to DL models, which usually\nrequire significant computational resources and time for\ntraining.\n\nHerein, we introduce miniSNV, a novel SNV calling method\n\n\noptimized for ONT long reads. miniSNV leverages read pileup,\nread-based phasing, and consensus generation to discover and\ngenotype SNVs. miniSNV also utilizes the known common\nvariants in populations to swiftly pinpoint high-quality variants.\nThe results demonstrate that miniSNV has higher or competitive\nF1-scores for SNV calling compared to the state-of-the-art\napproaches. Moreover, miniSNV is most memory-efficient and\noffers the fastest processing speeds and scalability. Given these\nadvantages, we believe miniSNV has the potential to become a\npivotal tool in upcoming genomic studies.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n\nUsing sorted BAM files provided by commonly used read aligners\nsuch as Minimap2  as input, miniSNV applies several strategies including read pileup, read-based phasing, and consensus\ngeneration to detect and genotype SNVs. The approach has four\nmajor steps shown in Fig. 1.\n\n1. miniSNV applies read pileup to recognize the candidate loci\n\n\n### Candidate loci generation and classification\n\nminiSNV first filters out all the read alignments with low mapping quality (default MAPQ _<20),_ supplementary alignments, secondary alignments, and unmapped reads. Then, miniSNV applies\nread pileup by extracting the detailed information from alignment\nsuccessively and statistic the cumulative count of different alleles\n(\u2018A, C, G, T\u2019) in a genome position. Subsequently, compare the\nratio _Ralt_ = Nalt/Ntotal and a user-defined threshold (default 0.2) at\na genome position pos, where _Naltis_ the count of an alternative\nallele and _Ntotal_ is the total number of valid alignments. The\nposition with the specific alternative allele (identified by the UID)\nis marked as a candidate locus if _Ralt_ is larger than the threshold.\nEach alternative allele is considered separately.\n\n\nwith divergences between reads and reference for variant\ncalling. The candidate loci are divided into two categories,\ni.e. high- and low-quality loci, relying on the prebuilt known\ncommon variants and the complexity of the signatures (such\nas density, spatial distance, and so on) around the corresponding loci.\n\n\nminiSNV searches for the UID of each candidate locus in the\n\nknown common variants in populations. If the locus is found\nand _Ralt>0.3,_ it is classified as high-quality. If the locus is not\nfound but meets the following two conditions, it also qualifies\nas high-quality: (i) _Ralt>0.7;_ (ii) no other candidate loci within 10\nbase pairs upstream and downstream. The combination of _Ralt_\nthreshold of 0.3\u20130.7 was selected according to a series of in-house\nexperiments shown in [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S1 available online\nat http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/. All remaining loci are classified\nas low-quality. It is worth noting that, long reads often suffer\nfrom distinguishing the real number of repeat bases in some lowcomplexity regions including simple repeat (homopolymer) and\ntandem repeat due to the systemic random sequencing insertion\nand deletion errors. Simple statistical methods cannot depict\nthe variant accurately usually, and thus, any candidate locus\nlocated in the low-complexity region is classified as low-quality\nby introducing the corresponding annotations.\n\n\n2. miniSNV assigns the genotypes for high-quality loci by com\nparing the likelihoods of possible genotypes using a binomial\nmodel and uses WhatsHap  to phase all the heterozygotes and haplotag variants by the raw reads to generate\nhaplotype-specific phased alignment.\n\n\n3. miniSNV inputs the phased alignments and collects two\n\nsets of reads having a haplotag of 1 and 2 indicating\nwhich haplotype the read inherits from respectively. For\nan active region centered on a low-quality locus, miniSNV\nextracts all the overlapped reads and employs multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA) or local assembly to generate\nconsensus sequences of the involved read parts on different\nread sets.\n\n\n4. miniSNV aligns the generated consensus sequence against\n\nthe local reference sequence of the candidate region and\nidentifies alternative alleles from the realigned information. Finally, miniSNV applies a haplotype-aware genotyping pipeline for variant calling and filtering on all lowquality loci.\n\n\n### Genotyping for high-quality candidate loci\n\nminiSNV employs a biallelic assumption to assign genotypes for\nthe high-quality loci which compares the likelihoods of three\npossible genotypes computed by a binomial model based on the\nsupporting read evidence and chooses the largest one as the\ncorresponding genotype. The model is defined as:\n\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\n\n_Likelihood (0/0)_ = [\u2212]2 _[p]_ [\u00d7] _[(]_ [\u2212] _[\u03b8)][Nref]_ [\u00d7][ \u03b8] _[Nalt]_\n\n_Likelihood (0/1)_ = p \u00d7 \ufffd 12 \ufffdNref +Nalt\n\n_Likelihood (1/1)_ = [\u2212]2 _[p]_ [\u00d7] _[(]_ [\u2212] _[\u03b8)][Nalt][ \u00d7]_ _[\u03b8]_ _[Nref]_\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. **The** **workflow** **of** **miniSNV** **approach.** **(A)** Using read pileup to recognize the candidate loci and divide the loci into high- and low-quality. (B)\nUsing read-based phasing and consensus generation to detect and genotype SNVs (HP1: Haplotype 1; HP2: Haplotype 2).\n\n\nwhere _\u03b8_ is the probability that a read is mapped to a given\n\nzygosity erroneously (default value, 0.03 for SNV), which is\nobtained empirically and independently between all observations.\n_Nref_ and _Naltare_ the number of supporting reads for reference\nand alternative alleles, respectively.p is the prior probability for\na heterozygous genotype, and herein the prior distribution is\nconfigured as equal for all three genotypes. miniSNV normalizes\nthe likelihoods by computing the log sum of exponentials and\nproduces the phred-scaled variant calling quality score for each\nhigh-quality SNV.\n\n\n### Phasing and haplotagging using high-quality variants\n\nLong-read sequencing offers significant benefits in read-based\nphasing, leveraging additional information beyond genotypes\nto ascertain allele relationships across multiple variant loci. It\nidentifies heterozygote variants from homologous chromosomes\nand annotates raw reads with specific variants, enhancing\nsignal accuracy within individual haplotypes and mitigating\nsystematic errors. miniSNV initially selects heterozygote variants\nwith quality scores exceeding 15 from a high-quality variant\nset. Then miniSNV utilizes WhatsHap (version 2.0) to phase\nand haplotag the variants, generating a haplotype tag list that\ncorrelates alignments with haplotypes. Reads are grouped into\nthree phasing sets based on distinct tags {0, 1, 2}, with sets 1\nand 2 being deemed valid if their corresponding read counts\nexceed a user-defined threshold (default 2). Reads within valid\nsets are utilized to generate a consensus sequence and identify\nvariants in low-quality loci. Notably, sets with tag 0 are unphased\nand considered invalid. In cases where all three sets are invalid,\nall reads contribute to generating two consensus sequences\n\n\n### Haplotype generation and genotyping for low-quality candidate loci\n\nminiSNV also genotypes the low-quality loci based on the original\nsupporting reads of reference and alternative alleles (termed\n\u2018preGT\u2019). The accuracy of \u2018preGT\u2019 is influenced by systematic\nerrors, dense variants, or fewer signal features in local areas.\nFor an active region which centers on a low-quality locus and\nextends 100 bp to both upstream and downstream, miniSNV\nfurther applies local assembly or MSA to generate consensus\nsequences (termed local haplotypes) from haplotype-specific\nphased alignment to eliminate false positive. The MSA-based\nmodel is used if more than 70% of all reads are spanning reads.\nOtherwise, the assembly-based model is used.\n\n\nIf the MSA-based model is selected, miniSNV extracts seg\n\nments from all the spanning reads and overlapped reads with\nan overlapping ratio over 0.6 in a specific active region, and\nthen employs an external MSA tool to reconstruct at most two\ncandidate haplotypes of the active region. We tried several stateof-the-art MSA tool such as abPOA , FMAlign , HAlign \non quite a number of local genomic regions, and found that abPOA\nis most suited to the task. FMAalign and HAalign also showed\ngood ability and performance, however, they seem not support\nto produce multiple consensus sequences at heterozygous sites.\nThus, abPOA is employed in the current version of miniSNV.\n\nIf the assembly-based model is selected, all the segments from\n\n\noverlapped reads exclude reads with an overlapping ratio of less\nthan 0.4 are extracted, and the local de novo assembly is run\nusing a de Bruijn graph approach similar to that described for\nManta . The length of the k-mers is incrementally increased\nfrom 31 to 121, in 10 steps, to manage and avoid loops in the\nde Bruijn graph. Contigs generated in the previous iteration are\n\n\n-----\n\nround. At most two consensus sequences are derived from the de\nBruijn graph, prioritizing variants that have the highest degree of\nread support, and score variants. The MSA-based assembly model\nonly generates one consensus sequence for a valid phasing set\nwhich implies that the sequencing data has yielded sufficient\ninformation to determine the phase of alleles that are located\non the same chromosome. If no valid phasing set exists in the\nprevious stage, two consensus sequences from all reads will be\ngenerated as local haplotypes to distinguish the origination of\nvariants.\n\nHaplotype generation for an active region is considered unsuc\n\nGIAB were employed as the ground truth. The results are shown\nin Fig. 2.\n\nminiSNV simultaneously achieved the highest F1-score and\n\n\ncessful if the MSA or assembly procedure is unable to generate\nat least one non-reference haplotype, which also means that no\nvariants will be called in that active region. After filtering haplotypes with less than three supporting reads, the remaining are\naligned to the local reference part using KSW2 . Alternative\nalleles found within 10 bp of the low-quality candidate locus are\nannotated as \u2018discovered\u2019. miniSNV determines the genotype of\nthe discovered allele depending on the number of times it appears\non different haplotypes. The genotype is assigned \u20180/0\u2019, \u20180/1\u2019, \u20181/1\u2019\nif the number of appearances is 0, 1, 2, respectively. The genotypes\nassigned in this stage are termed as \u2018hapGT\u2019.\n\nIn general, miniSNV determines the final genotypes according\n\n\nto hapGT, but there is one case that needs special explanations.\nIf preGT is \u20180/1\u2019 while hapGT is \u20181/1\u2019, the \u20180/1\u2019 represents that all\nthe reads containing alternative alleles should be located in one\nhaplotype (Paternal or Maternal). But \u20181/1\u2019 shows that reads containing alternative alleles are randomly scattered in two different\nhaplotypes that may be caused by systematic errors and should\nfilter out this variant to avoid false positives. Once determined,the\ngenotypes are assigned based on the supporting reads of reference\nand alternative alleles obtained by an MSA-based or assemblybased model.\n\n## Results\n\n\nrecall, all of which were greater than 99.7%, and closer precision\non HG002, HG003, and HG004 sup-datasets (Fig. 2A and 2B,\n[Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S2 available online at [http://bib.oxfordjourn](http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/)\nals.org/). Three SNVs called from sup-datasets that could be only\ndetected by miniSNV were displayed in [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Fig. S1\navailable online at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/. All the SNVs\nwere situated in relatively complex genomic regions characterized by numerous closely related variant candidates and\ninconsistent read alignments around short tandem repeat. For\nthe hac-datasets, miniSNV outperformed Clair3 on HG003 (miniSNV:0.9971 and Clair3:0.9970) hac-dataset due to its higher recall,\nbut inferior to Clair3 on HG002 (miniSNV:0.9971 and Clair3:0.9979)\nand HG004 (miniSNV:0.9974 and Clair3:0.9980) hac-datasets\nfor F1-score (Fig. 2D and 2E, [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S3 available\nonline at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/). The performance of\nLongshot was significantly lower than miniSNV and Clair3 for\ndifferent metrics especially the _<99%_ recalls on all datasets,\nwhich represented that Longshot would omit a certain number\nof variants. In addition, recalls on HG003 sup-dataset and hacdataset were also lower compared with HG002 and HG004. Still,\nminiSNV had relatively consistent precisions and recalls across\ndifferent samples and technologies, which demonstrated the\nstable calling performance of miniSNV.\n\nWe also assessed the Mendelian laws of inheritance among\n\n\nWe applied real and simulated sequencing data to evaluate\nthe performance of miniSNV and other two state-of-the-art\ncallers, a statistical-based caller Longshot (version 0.4.5) and\na DL-based caller Clair3 (version 1.0.4) that Oxford Nanopore\nofficially recommended to identify SNVs. The real Nanopore\nsequencing data were generated from well-studied GIAB trio\nsamples (HG002, HG003, and HG004) under different sequencing\nchemistry and basecallers. Minimap2 (version 2.24-r1122) was\nused to align the real sequencing data with optimized parameters\n(\u2212x map-ont). miniSNV and Longshot utilized default setting to\nidentify SNVs, while the latest model trained by ONT [(https://](https://github.com/nanoporetech/rerio/tree/master/clair3_models)\n[github.com/nanoporetech/rerio/tree/master/clair3_models) was](https://github.com/nanoporetech/rerio/tree/master/clair3_models)\nadopted for Clair3. Several metrics involving precision, recall, F1score for individual and Mendelian Consistency Rate (MCR) and\nthe Homozygous Discovery Rate (HDR) for trio are detailed in\nSupplementary Notes (\u2018Evaluation Metrics\u2019 section).\n\n### Results on GIAB Ashkenazi trio ONT data using kit v14 and basecalled with dorado\n\n\ntrios including MCR and HDR. miniSNV and Longshot exhibited higher MCRs than Clair3 by \u223c3% in both sup-datasets\n(Fig. 2C, [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S4 available online at [http://bib.](http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/)\n[oxfordjournals.org/)](http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/) and hac-datasets (Fig. 2F, [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data)\nTable S5 available online at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/). And\nas for HDR, miniSNV surpassed Clair3 and Longshot by 1.8% and\n1.6% in sup-dataset, and by 3.4% and 1.8% in hac-dataset for\nthe paternal sample (HG003). For the maternal sample (HG004),\nLongshot led slightly ahead of miniSNV, with Clair3 close behind.\nCompared with Clair3 and Longshot, miniSNV demonstrates\nremarkable stability and high performance in both MCR and\nHDR, which represents the quality and reliability of variant calling\nthrough family sample analysis, and makes it a robust choice for\ngenomic studies focused on trios.\n\n### Results on HG002 ONT data basecalled with guppy, and the comparison\n\n\n0.62%, 0.33% and 0.05%, 1.83%, 0.96% improvements on precision, recall and F1-score than Clair3 and Longshot, respectively (Fig. 3A, [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S6 available online at\nhttp://bib.oxfordjournals.org/). Only miniSNV obtained the F1score over 99% on k12-data. By comparing the results between\nk12-data and k14-data, k14-data enhanced the recalls by 1.02%,\n1.64%, and 1.77% for miniSNV, Clair3, and Longshot, while slightly\nimproving the precisions (Fig. 3B, [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S2 available online at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/). The comparison\n\n\nWe analyzed additional real sequencing data from GIAB sample\nHG002, sequenced via simplex nanopore with ligation sequencing\nkit v12 and R10.4 flowcells (FLO-PRO112), to evaluate variant\ncallers across different sequencing elements like flowcell type,\nchemistry, and base calling methods. The variant calling outcomes for HG002 ONT data which basecalled with Guppy 5.0.15\nusing kit v12 (k12-data) and kit v14 (k14-data) are displayed in\nFig. 3 and Fig. 4.\n\nminiSNV showed some advantages on k12-data with 0.02%,\n\n\nWe benchmarked miniSNV, Clair3, and Longshot on the GIAB\nAshkenazi Trio that were sequenced with two PromethION flow\ncells using the ligation sequencing kit v14 chemistry and R10.4.1\nflowcells around 200 Gbases per sample. Dorado with sup (sup) and hac (hac-) mode was used to basecall and generate mean\n70x sequencing coverage datasets for HG002, HG003 and HG004,\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. **Benchmarking** **results** **on** **GIAB** **Ashkenazi** **trio** **ONT** **data.** _(A)_ F1-score, (B) precision, recall, and (C) MCR, HDR-M for HG004 and HDR-F for\nHG003 of different callers on sup-datasets.

The benchmarking results at\ncoverages from 30\u00d7 to 70\u00d7 of k12-data and k14-data are\nshown in Fig. 3C [(Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S7 available online\nat http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/) and Fig. 3D [(Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data)\nTable S8 available online at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/). On the\nk12-data, miniSNV achieved the best F1-scores on all the datasets\nwith different coverage, especially for 50\u00d7 and 60\u00d7 datasets. For\nthe k14-data, the difference between miniSNV and Clair3 was\nslight, with miniSNV showing better results than Clair3 on the\ndataset with a coverage depth exceeding 60\u00d7. It was worth noting\nthat, the improvement in data quality contributed to an \u223c1%\nincrease in the F1-score for all three callers across datasets with\ndifferent coverage depths.\n\nWe compared variant-calling performance in difficult-to\n\nmap regions and low-complexity regions of the genome which\ndefined by GIAB v3.3 stratifications, and the results on HG002\nwith k12-data (Fig. 4A and 4B, [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S9 available online at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/) and k14-data\n(Fig. 4C and 4D, [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S10 available online at\nhttp://bib.oxfordjournals.org/) under these regions are shown.\nNo significant precision differences between miniSNV and\nClair3 were noted in regions outside high-confidence areas,\nsuch as segmental duplications and low-mappability regions.\nHowever, miniSNV excelled within specific low-complexity\n\n\n_SimpleRepeat_homopolymer_4to6_ and _LD_discordant_haplotypes)_\n\nfor both datasets, although it underperformed in _SimpleRe-_\n_peat_quadTR_20to50_ and _segdups._ We generated candidate haplotypes (more details refer to the Materials and methods) in\nsome low-complexity regions and aligned them against the\nlocal reference sequence to recall more SNVs. This ensured that\nrecalls were consistently higher for miniSNV across both datasets.\nHowever, due to inaccurate consensus sequence construction of\nrepeat regions, more false positives may be identified, resulting\nin poor precision in some regions.\n\n### Impact of incorporating known common variants on the performance of SNVs identification\n\nWe further designed this section to assess whether integrating\nestablished genetic information enhances the accuracy, speed,\nand reliability of SNVs identification within various genomic\ncontexts. We applied two HG002 sequencing datasets, i.e. k12and k14-data, and detected the SNVs without relying on known\ncommon variants. The detailed results of this evaluation are\ndocumented in [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S11 available online\nat http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/. The analysis indicates that\nincorporating known common variants from the population\ninto the SNVs calling workflow not only significantly speeds\nup the detection process but also enhances the accuracy of the\noutcomes. Specifically, on the k12-data dataset, we observed a\nprecision increase of 0.12% and an F1-score improvement of\n0.04%. On the k14-data dataset, all evaluation metrics showed\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. **Benchmarking** **results** **on** **HG002** **with** **k12- and** **k14-data.** Precision, recall, and F1-score of different callers on (A) k12-data and (B) k14-data.\nF1-score of different callers under different sequencing coverages ranges from 30\u00d7 to 70\u00d7 on (C) k12-data and (D) k14-data.\n\n\nF1-score by 0.12%. Additionally, the running speed reduced by\n\u223c15% on average.\n\nIn addition, we explored two SNVs at positions 62 534 004\n\non chromosome 1 and 20 104 697 on chromosome 10 of the\nGRCh38 reference genome, which surrounded by divergent\nindel patterns. These SNVs could be accurately detected\nwhen incorporating known common variants but were overlooked without their inclusion. Notably, these SNVs were also\nmissed by both Clair3 and Longshot. The example, derived\nfrom the k14-data, is depicted in a snapshot from Integrative\nGenome Viewer shown in [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Fig. S2 available\nonline at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/. This finding suggests\nthat leveraging the prior knowledge of common variants\nwithin the population can enhance the reliability of identifying certain SNVs that frequently occur in populations\n\n\ninconsistent read mapping. Given these substantial enhancements in performance, we recommend the integration of known\ncommon variants from the widespread large-scale population\ngenome projects when conducting variant calling on human\ngenomic data.\n\n### Results on various simulated datasets\n\n\nDue to the limited availability of real sequencing datasets and\nground truth variants beyond GIAB standard samples, and their\nextensive use as labeled datasets in DL model training, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance and generalizability of DL versus statistical-based methods. We selected\nfour species, i.e. Human, Mouse, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis,\nand generated ONT-like datasets using Pbsim3 (version 3.0.4).\nChromosome 2 was used for both Human and Mouse genomes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. **Benchmarking** **results** **on** **HG002** **with** **k12- and** **k14-data** **outside** **high-confidence** **regions.** Comparison of (A) precision and (B) recall outside\nhigh-confidence regions between miniSNV and Clair3 on k12-data.

The details for the implementation of simulated datasets referred to the Supplementary\nNotes.\n\nThe evaluation results of the three competing callers across\n\n\nthese four simulated datasets are presented in Fig. 5\n\n[(Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S12 available online at http://bib.oxfordjou\nrnals.org/). In general, miniSNV was the best caller on identifying\nSNVs on simulated datasets, and followed by Longshot and Clair3.\nIn the two 60\u00d7 sequencing datasets, miniSNV outperformed\nLongshot by 0.36% (99.4% versus 99.58%) and 0.34% (99.90%\nversus 99.56%) in F1 scores, and by 0.75% (99.94% versus 99.18%)\nand 0.74% (99.90% versus 99.16%) in sensitivities, respectively.\nAs for the relative low coverage sequencing datasets, the\nperformance of miniSNV and Longshot was comparable, with\nboth winning and losing. It was clear that miniSNV balanced\nbetween precision and recall while Longshot showed relative\n\n\nlower recalls. Importantly, we also found that the results of Clair3\nwere unexpectedly lower than that of miniSNV and Longshot\ndue to the unacceptable recalls, especially, on the three nonhuman species. The huge difference in Clair3\u2019s performance\nbetween real datasets and simulated datasets, may indicate\nthat DL methods have difficulty in achieving good generalization\nwhen dealing with data from different species or with certain\ncharacteristic differences. In [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Fig. S3 available\nonline at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/, two SNVs called from\nthe simulated dataset of Arabidopsis could not be detected by\nClair3, despite having clear and ample supporting signatures.\n\nWe investigated the impact of GC content, which ranges\n\n\nfrom 20% to 70% in various bacterial genomes, for its relevance\nto genome complexity on variant identification by simulating\ndiploid-like datasets. These simulations aimed to assess the\nperformance of different callers as GC content varied. The\nresults are presented in [Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S13 available\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. **Benchmarking** **results** **on** **simulated** **datasets** **for** **different** **species.** _(A)_ F1-score, (B) precision and recall of different callers with simulated\ndatasets for four different species.\n\n\nonline at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/. miniSNV consistently\noutperformed Longshot and Clair3 across all datasets. It was\nobvious that statistical-based methods were robust to genomes\nof varying GC content, and the DL methods could suffer from the\navailability of ample and reliable datasets with ground truth to\nlearn the model for a specific genome.\n\n### The runtime and memory usage of different callers\n\n\nconsumption range from 4GB to 5GB with the increase in data\nsize, while Clair3 increased linearly.\n\n## Discussion and Conclusion\n\n\nWe assessed the speed and memory footprints of the SNV\ncallers on the HG002 dataset sequenced by kit v14 chemistry\nand basecalled by Dorado sup mode. The results are provided in Fig. 6A [(Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) Table S14 available online at\nhttp://bib.oxfordjournals.org/). Generally, using a single CPU\nthread, miniSNV was the fastest caller followed by Clair3, and 4\ntimes faster than Longshot. When using multiple CPU threads,\nminiSNV and Clair3 had high scaling performance, i.e. they\nachieved a quasi-linear speedup with the number of CPU threads\nand their wall clock time was greatly reduced. Longshot was not\nincluded mainly because it does not support multiple-thread\ncomputing. When considering the memory footprint, miniSNV\n(4.76 GB) was smaller than Clair3 (10.84 GB) and Longshot\n(88.13 GB) by 2 times and 20 times under a single CPU thread. More\nimportantly, with the increase of threads used, the memory usage\nof miniSNV has no significant changes, which represents that\nminiSNV is suitable for parallel processing but without memory\npressure.\n\nWe further applied the down-sampled datasets with sequenc\n\nDeep learning and statistical-based methods have been widely\napplied to variant calling with long reads sequencing, which\ncan generate high-quality SNV calls and enable investigations in\nthe repetitive and difficult-to-map genomic regions. Read-based\nphasing has been used to determine the haplotype structure\nand group the reads that are inherited from a single haplotype.\nUsing the grouped reads, a consensus sequence can be generated\nthat represents the most common sequence of the sample. The\ncomprised two strategies, i.e. read-based phasing and consensus\ngeneration, can greatly improve the accuracy of variant identification by reducing false positives from systematic errors and help to\ndiscover variants that cannot be directly perceived due to limited\nsignatures and alignment bias, by local realignment and groups\nof alleles inherited together.\n\nHerein, we propose miniSNV, a novel SNV caller, to achieve\n\n\naccurate, fast, and scalable SNV identification with ONT long\nreads, mainly depending on the algorithm characteristics of the\nfollowing four aspects.\n\n1. miniSNV uses known common variants in population\n\n\ning coverages ranging from 30\u00d7 to 70\u00d7, to benchmark the\nperformance of miniSNV and Clair3 along with the data size\nusing 16 CPU threads. The results are provided in Fig. 6B\n[(Supplementary Table S14 available online at http://bib.oxfordjour](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data)\nnals.org/). We found that the runtime of miniSNV decreased\nlinearly as the amount of data size decreased. But Clair3\nmaintained a runtime of \u223c120 min for various datasets. It was\nworth noting that, for the 30\u00d7 dataset, miniSNV (60 min) was\nfaster than that of Clair3 (120 min) by 2 times. On the memory\n\n\n3. miniSNV employs read-based phasing using long reads\n\nspanning multiple high-quality heterozygote variants, to\n\n\nstudies as variation backgrounds to quickly identify highquality variants, instead of using the whole pangenome.\nThis lightweight usage can improve the power of variant\nidentification and significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity such as massive path search in variation graphs.\n\n\n2. miniSNV applies read pileup to find candidate loci heuris\ntically and categorize them into high- and low-quality loci\nrelying on the variation backgrounds and signature complexity. High- and low-quality loci are processed using different strategies to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. **Benchmarking** **results** **on** **simulated** **datasets** **for** **different** **species.** The runtime (bar chart) and memory footprints (line chart) of various\ncallers under (A) different CPU cores and (B) different sequencing coverage datasets.\n\n\nto the corresponding haplotype. The phasing information\ngreatly enhances signatures in a single haplotype which\nhelps to distinguish from systematic errors.\n\n\nspecies using DL methods, fine-tuning may be necessary to optimize performance .\n\nIn this study, we focus on the detection and genotyping of SNVs\n\n\n4. miniSNV adopts MSA and local assembly to generate a\n\nhaplotype consensus sequence. All the differences between\nthe consensus and reference genome by realignment are\nassigned together as variants. The consensus-based realignment helps to discover more variants omitted by alignment\nbias and limited signatures, especially for genomic regions\noutside high-confidence regions.\n\n\nReal ONT sequencing datasets were implemented on miniSNV\n\n\nalone, as accurate calling of short indels using ONT reads is challenging due to the systemic random sequencing errors, even with\nmore accurate ONT data . We will delve into the principles\nof ONT sequencing data generation and propose an advanced\nerror model for indels in homopolymers and short tandem repeats\nto improve the yield of indel identification. In addition, we will\napply our method to more sequencing platforms like PacBio and\nshort-read sequencing technologies for widespread use in human\ngenomic studies.\n\nOverall, with its excellent SNV identification and running per\n\nand another two state-of-the-art callers, Clair3 and Longshot,\nto evaluate the power of SNV identification and resource consumption. We derive three key observations from the benchmark.\nFirst, miniSNV demonstrates superior sensitivity and comparable accuracy, while maintaining remarkable stability and high\nperformance in GIAB Ashkenazi Trio datasets, which facilitates\nfamily sample analysis and genomic studies focused on trios.\nSecond, the comparison between two GIAB HG002 datasets differed in flowcell, chemistry, and basecaller demonstrates that\nminiSNV always obtains satisfying results (the only caller with F1score over 99%) even on the ONT dataset with high sequencing\nerrors (kit v12). Moreover, on both datasets, miniSNV demonstrates a more pronounced advantage in SNV identification in\nlow-complexity and difficult-to-map genomic regions. Third, miniSNV is the fastest caller and achieves a nearly-linear multiplethread speedup, while maintaining stable and relatively lower\nmemory consumption, which is suited to modern HPC resources\nand helpful for large-scale genomics studies.\n\nIn addition, we conducted simulation studies on diverse species\n\n\nto further scrutinize the performance of three callers. miniSNV\nand longshot, grounded in statistical algorithms, maintain consistent performance regardless of species or sequencing depth. However, Clair3, which relies on DL, exhibits somewhat diminished\nstability and generalization, which is mainly reflected in the poor\nsensitivity. These findings indicate that, to some extent, variant\ncalling methods utilizing DL have stringent demands on training\ndata, and the availability of ample and reliable datasets for a\nspecific species is vital, even though they are not always read\n\nformance, miniSNV is suited to detect SNVs for ONT data. We\nbelieve that miniSNV can provide highly efficient and reliable\nanalysis for cutting-edge genomic studies.\n\n**Key** **Points**\n\n  - miniSNV is an accurate and stable tool that is suitable\n\nfor SNV detection from ONT sequencing data, regardless\nof the sequencing modes and detected species.\n\n  - miniSNV utilizes read pileup and the prior knowledge\n\nof common variants in population studies to group the\ncandidate loci and improve the sensitivity and speed of\nSNV detection.\n\n  - miniSNV leverages local haplotype consensus genera\ntion and consensus-based realignment to achieve accurate SNV identification outside high-confidence regions.\n\n  - miniSNV is a fast and lightweight tool that has out\nstanding scalability and lower memory footprints, which\nis suitable for most modern computers and helpful for\nlarge-scale genomics studies.\n\n## Supplementary data\n\n\n[Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bib/bbae473#supplementary-data) data is available at _Briefings_ _in_ _Bioinformatics_\n\n\n-----\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### miniSNV: accurate and fast single nucleotide variant calling from nanopore sequencing data\n\n**Reference**: Cui, M., et al., _Briefings in Bioinformatics_, 2024, 25(6), bbae473.

How- ever, in the related field of metagenomic binning, contigs are routinely clus- tered using information from both the contig sequences and their abundance. We introduce Taxometer, a neural network based method that improves the annotations and estimates the quality of any taxonomic classifier using contig abundance profiles and tetra-nucleotide frequencies. We apply Taxometer to five short-read CAMI2 datasets and find that it increases the average share of correct species-level contig annotations of the MMSeqs2 tool from 66.6% to 86.2%. Additionally, it reduce the share of wrong species-level annotations in the CAMI2 Rhizosphere dataset by an average of two-fold for Metabuli, Centrifuge, and Kraken2. Futhermore, we use Taxometer for benchmarking taxonomic classifiers on two complex long-read metagenomics data sets where ground truth is not known. Taxometer is available as open-source software and can enhance any taxonomic annotation of metagenomic contigs.\n\n\nCheck for updates\n\n\nMetagenomic classifiers annotate reads or contigs with taxonomic\ninformation by searching for similar substrings in a collection of\nreference sequences. The quality of annotations depends on the chosen method[\u2013] as well as the reference database, requiring a careful\nselection of tools depending on the research context. Due to the high\ncomplexity of metagenomics data and inevitable database incompleteness, full sample characterization is not usually achieved.\n\nMost metagenomic classifiers rely on sequence similarity and\n\n\nwithout the use of a reference database[\u2013]. Binning implies that a\ncontig without a database match could be linked to a contig with the\ndatabase match via similarity of feature vectors.\n\nThe taxonomic label is a hierarchical object containing a path from\n\n\nwork by querying databases for matches to individual contigs. If any\nindividual contig has no match in the database, the string cannot be\nclassified. However, in the related field of metagenomic binning,\ncontigs from the same organism are successfully linked according to\ncontig-contig feature similarity, such as tetra-nucleotide frequencies\n(TNFs) or abundances[\u2013]. These links are used to group contigs to\nreconstruct metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from poorly\nstudied environments with insufficient database representation,\n\n\nthe highest taxonomic rank, phylum to a more precise label, such as\nspecies. A classification problem can be reduced to only predict a class\non the selected taxonomic level (e.g. species) provided as a one-hot\nvector at the training time. However, a deep hierarchical loss widely\nused in e.g. the field of computer vision[\u2013] reflects phylogenetic\nsimilarity of the true and the predicted node, and therefore allows\nmodeling loss for the full lineage of nested labels. Similar hierarchical\napproaches for microbial data were previously used for predicting the\ntaxonomies from different data types such as rRNA sequences[,] and\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy[,]. To the best of our\nknowledge, such loss has not been applied in the field of DNA\nsequences taxonomic classification, where the prediction are either\n\n\n1Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 1, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark. 2The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for\nProtein Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3A, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark.

Taxonomic profiling workflow using Taxometer. After assembling the metagenomic reads, contigs are annotated with any taxonomic classifier.\nContigs are processed via Taxometer to extract abundances and tetra-nucleotide\nfrequencies. Taxometer is then trained on the extracted features to predict the\n\nlimited to one taxonomic level[\u2013] or the functionality of the deep\nhierarchical loss is approximated by chaining neural network layers.\n\nIn this work we propose a method to enhance taxonomic profiling\n\nby utilizing the features that are used for binning. Our method, Taxometer, is designed to run on any standard metagenomics dataset of\none or more samples where annotation of the contigs is required.\nTaxometer is based on a neural network that uses TNFs, abundances,\nand taxonomic labels from any metagenomic classifier. By the use of\nan abundance vector, Taxometer utilises the multisample experiment\nsetup, that, to the best of our knowledge, was never attempted in the\ncontext of taxonomic classification before. The neural network is then\ntrained to predict taxonomy for this particular dataset using the subset\nof contigs that have an annotation. Finally, the trained network is\napplied to the input contigs resulting in refined taxonomic labels of\ncontigs as well as annotation of contigs without taxonomic labels\n(Fig. 1). As the taxonomic labels contain the full path from the taxonomic root to the placement on the bacterial taxonomic tree, we\nimplemented a tree based hierarchical loss (Supplementary Fig. 1). This\nallows partial annotations not covering all taxonomic levels and that\nTaxometer can predict across all taxonomic levels accompanied by\nscores ranging from 0.5 to 1. After selecting the labels that pass the\nuser-defined threshold, the workflow results in refined taxonomy\nannotations, containing more true positives and fewer false positives\ncompared to the input taxonomy classification.\n\n## Results\n#### Improving contig annotations of short-read based metagenomics\nTo demonstrate that Taxometer could improve the annotations of\ndifferent taxonomic classifiers, we trained it on MMseqs2 and\nMetabuli configured to use the GTDB database and on Centrifuge\n\n\ntaxonomic annotations. A hierarchical loss allows training the model on the\nannotations from all levels. The predictions are then made for all taxonomic levels\nfor each contig (e.g. completing the annotation from Actinomycetales order to\nBifidobacteruim animalis species). For each label, a score is provided.\n\nand Kraken2 configured to use the NCBI database. For the CAMI2\nhuman microbiome datasets we found that MMseqs2 correctly annotated on average 66.6% of contigs at species level (Fig. 2a). When\napplying Taxometer, trained on the MMseqs2 annotations, the amount\nof correct annotated contigs increased to 86.2%. Additionally, when\napplied to two more challenging datasets, CAMI2 Marine and Rhizopshere, Taxometer increased the MMseqs2 annotation level from\n78.6% to 90%, and from 61.1% to 80.9%, respectively (Fig. 2c). This was\nreflected in F1-score improvements of the annotation of between 0.1\nand 0.13 for the human microbiome datasets. When we applied\nMetabuli, Centrifuge, and Kraken2 to the CAMI2 human microbiome\ndatasets, they correctly annotated on average >94.8% of contigs at\nspecies level. Here, Taxometer did not improve on this close-to-perfect\nannotation level but also did not decrease performance (F1-score\nabsolute change < 0.002). However, when applied to the Marine and\nRhizosphere datasets, the performance of the three methods was\nmuch lower. For instance, Metabuli provided wrong species annotations for 12.7% and 37.6% of the two datasets, respectively (Fig. 2c,\nSupplementary Fig. 2). Here, Taxometer reduced the number of wrong\nannotations to 7.6% and 15.4%, increasing F1-score from 0.87 to 0.88\nand from 0.61 to 0.69 respectively. Similarly, for Centrifuge and Kraken2 applied to the Rhizosphere dataset, Taxometer reduced the\namount of wrong annotations from\n\n68.7% to 39.5% (F1-score from 0.22 to 0.27) and from 28.7% to\n\n13.3% (F1-score from 0.64 to 0.68), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nEven though Taxometer had high precision for taxonomic annotations\nit made mistakes and re-annotated a small amount of the correct\nMMseqs2 species-level annotations incorrectly (1.6%\u20133.3% on the\nCAMI2 human microbiome).

For MMseqs2, the F1-score improved\nfrom 0.28 to 0.847 for ZymoBIOMICS gut microbiome standard sample and from 0.623 to 0.889 for ZymoBIOMICS microbial community\nstandard sample. Finally, we investigated the importance of varying\nthe threshold of the annotation score. Here, we found that a threshold\nscore of 0.95 provided a good balance between recall and precision for\nmulti-sample datasets (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary\nFig. 6). Taken together, we found that Taxometer could fill annotation\ngaps and remove incorrect taxonomic labels of large numbers of\ncontigs from diverse environments, while only mislabeling a small\nminority of correctly labeled contigs.\n\n\nannotations. The comparisons are to the ground truth labels. (a) CAMI2 Gastrointestinal, (b) CAMI2 Marine and (c) CAMI2 Rhizosphere datasets. Source data are\nprovided as a Source Data file.\n\nimproved if the abudance vector only consisted of one sample. We,\ntherefore, only used the contigs from one sample from each of the 5\nhuman microbiome CAMI2 datasets (Airways, Oral, Skin, Urogenital,\nGastrointestinal). We observed that Taxometer still showed a major\nimprovement for the MMseqs2 annotations (F1-score increased from\n0.738 to 0.866 for the Airways dataset) and only slightly decreased the\nperformance for the best performing classifiers (with the largest drop\nin F1-score for the Skin dataset from 0.926 to 0.895), supporting our\nprevious findings when using the multi-sample abundance vector\n(Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, using Taxometer was beneficial in both\none-sample and multi-sample experiments.\n\n\n#### Using both abundance and TNF improved predictions\nGiven the ability of Taxometer to correctly predict new as well as\ncorrect wrong annotations we investigated the contribution of abundance and TNFs features for the predictions. We, therefore, trained\nTaxometer to predict MMseqs2 annotations for the CAMI2 human\nmicrobiome datasets using either the abundances or TNFs (Fig. 4a,\nSupplementary Fig. 7). Here we found that for higher taxonomic levels\n(phylum to genus) up to 98% of Taxometer annotations could be\nreproduced by training using only TNFs. This is in concordance with\nprevious findings that TNFs could be used to classify metagenomics\nfragments at the genus level and that abundance showed better strainlevel binning performance compared to TNFs[,]. The number of correct species labels predicted by the model that combined both TNFs\nand abundances was 18\u201335% larger than the models that only used\nTNFs or abundances for MMseqs2 annotations of the CAMI2 Airways\ndataset.\n\nSince the abundance vector was an important feature for pre\n\nMost metagenome binners use the abundance vector as well, so\n\nwe benchmarked Taxometer against the VAMB binner as a taxonomic\nlabels refinement tool. We ran VAMB on the CAMI2 datasets, which\nresults in contigs classified to bins. For each bin we determined the\nassigned taxonomy by selecting the majority taxonomic label of its\ncontigs using the Kraken2 taxonomic classifier. We assigned the bin\ntaxonomic label to each contig in this bin. Comparing the assigned\nlabels to ground truth, we determined that taxonomic classification\nafter this procedure was worse than both Kraken2 classification and\nthe Taxometer refinement of Kraken2 classification (86% correctly\nannotated contigs with the binning approach vs 91% from Kraken2\nresults) (Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus, binning alone cannot serve as a\ntaxonomic refinement tool, despite its use of the contigs abundances.\n\n\ndicting the labels, we investigated if the annotations were still\n\n\n#### Novel species were predicted at genus level\nTo explore the limitations of Taxometer we investigated the performance when species in the dataset were missing from the database. To\nachieve this we deleted annotations from five species in the CAMI2\nhuman microbiome MMseqs2 results before training Taxometer. This\nresulted in removing between 649 and 5127 contig annotations per\ndataset. As the deleted species were not in the training set, a perfect\nclassifier should assign missing labels to the contigs that belong to this\nspecies. In our experiments, Taxometer predicted the correct genus\n\n\n-----\n\n## true prediction false prediction missing prediction\n\n\n## Score threshold 0.95\n\n\n## a b\n\n GI\n\n Oral\n\n Skin\n Airways\n\n|GI Oral Skin Airway Urog|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n||||GI|\n|||||\n|||||\n||||Oral|\n||||Skin|\n||||Airway|\n|||Uro|g|\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||M|arine||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||R|hizo|||\n||||||||\n\n\n## Recall + +\n\n\n## Recall + +\n\n\nFig. 3 | Precision-recall curves.

Y-axis: ratio between the number of\ncontigs of the deleted species (\u201cdeleted\u201d) and the number of contigs of the species\n\nlabel for all these contigs. However, the share of incorrectly assigned\nannotations at species level varied between 6% and 82% across the\nspecies and the datasets. For these wrong annotations, we found that\nthe number of contigs of the deleted and the assigned species, and the\nmean feature correlation between them were the most important\nfactors (Fig. 4b). We found that false positives tended to occur when\nthe assigned species were more prevalent in the training set than the\ndeleted species, e.g. in the Airways dataset Staphylococcus aureus was\nassigned to 1312 of 1879 contigs from the deleted species Staphylococcus epidermidis. That can be explained by Staphylococcus epidermidis being 17 times more prevalent in the training set than\nStaphylococcus aureus, with 78% of all contigs from the Staphylococcus\ngenus were from Staphylococcus aureus. Second, we found it to make\nmistakes when TNFs and abundances were highly correlated between\nthe deleted and the assigned species. For instance, in the Gastrointestinal dataset, 183 out of 229 contigs of the deleted Butyrivibrio\n\n\nthat was the most prevalent among the incorrectly assigned (\u201cassigned\u201d) in the\ntraining set. The color legend shows the share of correctly missing labels, equal to\n1 \u2212 FP, where FP is the share of false positives. FP is high when the assigned species\nwas more prevalent in the training set and TNFs and abundances are highly correlated between the deleted and the assigned species. Source data are provided as a\nSource Data file.\n\nhungatei species were assigned to Butyrivibrio sp900103635, that only\nhad 8 contigs in total. However, the pearson correlation of the mean\nfeature vectors for these two species was 0.99. Thus, for the contigs of\na novel taxon, Taxometer might assign a closely related taxon instead\nof returning a missing annotation.\n\n\n#### Taxometer improved recall for annotations on all confidence levels\nSome taxonomic classifiers provide an interface to threshold the\nconfidence of the taxonomic labels that they assign. As this will affect\nthe precision of the resulting annotations we tested Taxometer performance for five different confidence level values of the Kraken2\nclassifier on the CAMI2 datasets (Supplementary Fig. 10). For instance,\nusing the CAMI2 Gastrointestinal dataset and increasing the confidence of Kraken2 resulted in reduced F1-score 0.977 for the confidence value 0.0 to 0.859 for the confidence value 0.25, 0.825 for the\n\n\n-----\n\n### a\n\n**contigs**\n\n### b\n\n\ncompared to ground truth compared to classifier annotations\n\n25,000\n\n\nEstimate\n\nof classifier\n\nprecision,\n\nHuman Gut\n\nEstimate\n\nof classifier\n\nprecision,\n\nSludge\n\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\n**annotations**\n\n\n**predictions**\n\n\n### c\n\n d\n\n\n**taxonomic classifier**\n\ntrue annotation\n\nfalse annotation\n\n\n**Taxometer**\n\n**(cross-validation)**\n\ntrue prediction\n\nfalse prediction\n\n\nmissing annotation\n\n\nno prediction\n\n\nPrecision\n\nClassifier precision\n\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\n\nPrecision\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\nTaxometer precision,\nestimate of classifier precision\n\n\n0\n\nFig. 5 | Taxonomic profilers benchmarks and analysis of long-read datasets.\na K-fold evaluation description.

For the Rhizosphere dataset, where Kraken2 showed low precision with the default\nvalue 0.0, increasing the confidence value from 0.0 to 0.25 increased\nF1-score from 0.715 to 0.717. Here, Taxometer improved F1-score for\nconfidence level 0.25 to 0.731. While further increasing the confidence\nvalue to 0.5 and 0.75, Kraken2 F1-score dropped to 0.49 and 0.327, but\nTaxometer prediction stayed almost the same, with F1-score 0.72 for\nboth confidence levels (Supplementary Fig. 12). In conclusion, filtering\nthe output of a classifier by confidence level will result in better precision but lower recall. Here, we showed that Taxometer could\nimprove recall and precision leading to a better F1-score when applied\nto the filtered output.\n\n#### Taxometer as a benchmarking tool\nWe were interested in evaluating the performance of Taxometer for\nthe annotation of long-read based metagenomics. In absence of a\nsufficiently large dataset with ground truth available, we analysed\nZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard with 21 strains and one\nsample. Despite an abundance vector only consisting of a single\nnumber, Taxometer improved the F1-score of MMSeqs2 classifier from\n0.28 to 0.854, and made a 0.0-0.05 improvement for other classifiers.\nHowever, this dataset did not reflect real world data size and complexity. We, therefore, investigated if the consistency of Taxometer\nannotations could be used as a measure of classifier performance when\nground truth labels were missing. Because metagenomics binning has\nbeen able to generate hundreds of thousands of MAGs, TNFs and\n\n\nlevel for the Rhizosphere dataset, MMseqs2 and Metabuli classifiers. The total\nnumber of contigs for Taxometer predictions equals the number of annotations\ninitially returned by a classifier. c, d Real long-read datasets k-fold evaluation for\nHuman Gut and Sludge datasets. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nabundances carry a strong signal for contigs of the same origin. Thus,\nwe hypothesized that the ability of Taxometer to predict classifier\nannotations could reflect the performance of the classifier. Specifically, the more incorrect labels a classifier assigns to contigs of the\nsame origin, the harder it will be for Taxometer to reproduce the labels\nassigned by a classifier. Therefore, inconsistent annotations by a\nclassifier will decrease the score that Taxometer assigns to any taxa in\nthe dataset. Thus, Taxometer scores can be used as a proxy for classifier consistency.\n\n\nTo investigate this we acquired annotations of four classifiers for\n\nthe seven CAMI2 datasets, ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community\nStandard and ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard, as well as the\nadditional MetaMaps classifier for ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome\nStandard, resulting in 37 sets of taxonomic labels. We divided each\ndataset into five folds and trained Taxometer to predict the annotations of each classifier five times using a new fold as the validation set.\nWe then compared how well Taxometer predictions corresponsed to\nthe annotations of the particular classifier and the ground truth\n(Fig. 5a, c, Supplementary Fig. 13, Table 1). We found that Taxometer\nand classifier precision metrics were correlated with Spearman Correlation Coefficient of 1.0 across 3 out of 9 datasets, reflecting perfect\nranking, and >0.78 for 8 out of 9 datasets, which is equivalent to\nmaximum of only one misranked classifier (Fig. 5b, Supplementary\nFig. 14, Table 1). We also noticed that the dataset for which the Taxometer precision ranking was mostly incorrect (negative Spearman\ncorrelation) was a Microbial community dataset with only 303 contigs\nand only 1 sample. Thus, in the absence of ground truth labels the\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Table 1 | Spearman correlations between classifiers preci- sions evaluated on ground truth and Taxometer precisions evaluated with cross-validation\n\nDataset Spearman Number of Number of\ncorrelation contigs classifiers\n\nCAMI2 Airways 0.8 177,654 4\n\nCAMI2 Skin 1.0 166,513 4\n\nCAMI2 Oral 0.8 200,587 4\n\nCAMI2 Gastrointestinal 0.8 81,238 4\n\nCAMI2 Urogenital 1.0 57,233 4\n\nCAMI2 Rhizosphere 0.8 26,787 4\n\nCAMI2 Marine 1.0 209,385 4\n\nZymoBIOMICS Microbial \u22120.1 303 4\nCommunity Standard\n\nZymoBIOMICS Gut 0.78 84 5\nMicrobiome Standard\n\n\u201cNumber of classifiers\u201d column shows how many taxonomic classifiers were benchmarked (4 for\nshort-read datasets, 5 for a long-read dataset).\n\nprecision of Taxometer prediction for classifier labels could be used as\na benchmark for different taxonomic classifiers within a dataset.\n\n#### Benchmarking contig annotations of long-read datasets\nWe then identified two PacBio HiFi read datasets of complex metagenomes; 4 samples from the human gut microbiome and 3 samples\nfrom an anaerobic digestion reactor sludge. These datasets did not\nhave ground truth labels and when we applied either GTDB- or NCBIbased classifiers they disagreed for 28%\u201339% of the contigs at species\nlevel annotations (Supplementary Fig. 15). Therefore, we applied the\nk-fold evaluation scheme described above to use Taxometer precisions for benchmarking the classifiers. MetaMaps had the highest\nprecision of 0.95, but also the lowest share of annotated contigs on the\nspecies level (16%, while MMseqs2 annotated 49%). MMseqs2 had the\nsecond highest precision, i.e. 0.84 for the human gut dataset (Metabuli\n0.68, Centrifuge 0.62, Kraken2 0.68) (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 16a).\nThe precision and recall values for the MMseqs2 classifier were within\nthe range of values for the CAMI2 datasets ([0.8,0.95] for precision and\n\n[0.6,0.85] for recall) (Supplementary Fig. 16b). This was consistent with\nthe performance of the classifiers on the most difficult CAMI2 dataset,\nRhizosphere, and thus we concluded that MMseqs2 returned the most\nprecise annotations for both the human gut microbiome and sludge\ndatasets compared to any of the other classifiers.\n\n## Discussion\nIn summary, Taxometer can improve taxonomic annotations of any\ncontig-level metagenomic classifier. Importantly, as contig abundances are specific to a certain dataset Taxometer is trained on the fly\non each dataset. Therefore, even though Taxometer is designed as a\nsupervised deep learning method we do not transfer the model, try to\ngeneralize across datasets or pre-train on a different dataset.\n\nTested on the annotations of the two taxonomic classifiers across\n\nseveral real and simulated datasets, Taxometer both filled annotation\ngaps and deleted incorrect labels. Furthermore, Taxometer is designed\nas a lightweight tool that is less compute intensive than the taxonomic\nannotations themselves. For instance, annotation of the CAMI2 and\nlong-read datasets with MMSeqs2 took 2\u20134 h, while training Taxometer with a single GPU took <30 min for all datasets (Supplementary\nFig. 17). Similarly, training could be done using CPUs in 10\u2013120 min.\n\nAdditionally, Taxometer provides a metric for evaluating the\n\nquality of annotations in the absence of ground truth. The analysis of\nthe long-read datasets suggested that the performance was stable\nacross sequencing technologies. The main limitation of applying\nTaxometer to a metagenomics dataset is that read-level data is needed\n\n\nto calculate contig abundances for a particular dataset. Taxometer\ntherefore cannot be used to annotate contigs downloaded from a large\ndatabase without such information. However, taxonomic annotations\ncan be improved in any metagenomics experiment where reads are\navailable. This could be a metagenomics experiment run in-house in a\nlab or where corresponding read-level data is available for download\nfrom SRA or ENA. Therefore, we believe that Taxometer is broadly\napplicable for improving annotations across almost all metagenomics\ndatasets.\n\nWhile evaluating Taxometer on short-read datasets, we dis\ncovered that for 6 out 7 CAMI2 datasets (Airways, Oral, Skin, Urogenital, Gastrointestinal, and Marine) the benchmarked taxonomic\nclassifiers performed with a close to perfect accuracy making it difficult to compare the performance. While CAMI2 datasets remain the\nfield standard in evaluating metagenomic binners and taxonomic\nclassifiers, it highlights the need for harder synthetic datasets, that\nbetter represent the real data. Evaluating Taxometer on the long-read\ndata, we faced the opposite problem of not having a corresponding\nsynthetic dataset with taxonomic annotations of contigs. Therefore, it\nwas not possible to perform the same analysis as on the short-read\ndatasets, relying on k-fold evaluation and Taxometer benchmarking\ncapabilities for taxonomic classifiers. The number of new methods\nemerging in the fields of taxonomy annotation and metagenome binning call for new synthetic datasets, both for short- and long-read\ntechnologies, of the size and complexity of real-world data.\n\nEven though Taxometer uses the abundance vector similar to the\n\nmetagenome binners such as VAMB, simply assigning all the contigs in\na bin with a majority taxonomic label makes the annotations worse,\nhighlighting the contribution of the Taxometer network and\n\nhierarchical loss.\n\nTaxometer utilizes a flat softmax hierarchical loss to take into\n\naccount the structure of taxonomic labels. While hierarchical losses\nare far from new in the deep learning field, their application to taxonomic labels in the fields of metagenome binning and taxonomic\nclassification remains sparse. Future work could investigate different\nhierarchical losses in deep learning based metagenomic tools potentially improving metagenomic binning and taxonomic classification.\nFurthermore, Taxometer uses TNFs to analyse the DNA information of\na contig with a multilayer perceptron. This feature engineering\napproach can potentially be replaced by a more general DNA foundation model. In this case, instead of the extracted TNFs, a whole\ncontig or its embedding, produced by a foundation model, will be the\ninput to Taxometer. Future work in this direction will include benchmarking different foundation models and evaluating their ability to\nproduce meaningful contigs embedding in metagenome data context.\nCombining such a model pretrained on a large amount of relevant\ngenomes with a deep hierarchical loss showcased in this study is a\npromising avenue for the future of taxonomic classification methods.\n\nThe novel application of binning features used for classification of\n\nDNA sequences with a deep hierarchical loss paves the way for further\nadvances in deep learning applied to metagenomic data. Taxometer\ncan be applied to the results of any metagenome classifier using any\nbacterial phylogeny, making it applicable in a broad range of fields and\nbioinformatics workflows.\n\n## Methods\n#### Evaluation datasets\nFor the short-read benchmarks, we used synthetic CAMI2 datasets\nfrom five human microbiomes (Airways, Oral, Skin, Urogenital, and\nGastrointestinal) and two environmental microbiomes (Marine and\nRhizosphere). For the CAMI2 evaluations, we compared the results of\ntaxonomic classifiers and Taxometer to the provided ground truth\nlabels for each contig.\n\nWe benchmarked the two ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community\n\nStandards: ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard with 8\n\n\n-----\n\nbacteria and 2 yeasts sequenced with a short-read technology, and\nZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard with 21 strains sequenced\nwith a long-read technology. To acquire the analog of ground truth, we\nmapped the contigs to the provided reference genomes with BLAST,\nand the highest scoring result for each contig was used as the ground\ntruth. For the analysis to be compatible with the GTDB database, we\nonly used the contigs that mapped to bacterial genomes, resulting in\n303 and 84 contigs correspondingly.\n\nWe also benchmarked Taxometer using two real PacBio HiFi long\nread datasets, a\u2019human gut\u2019 dataset from human stool samples and\na\u2019sludge\u2019 dataset from anaerobic digestion reactor sludge (ENA\naccessions ERR10905741-ERR10905743). In the absence of a synthetic\nlong-read dataset with ground truth labels, the evaluations were done\non real datasets via k-fold evaluation.\n\n#### Data preprocessing\nFor short-read benchmarking, we used sample-specific assemblies for\nthe seven CAMI2 datasets: Airways (10 samples), Oral (10 samples),\nSkin (10 samples), Gastrointestinal (10 samples), Urogenital (9 samples), Marine (10 samples), Rhizosphere (21 samples), and the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard with 1 sample. For each\ndataset we aligned the synthetic short paired-end reads from each\nsample using bwa-mem (v.0.7.15) to the concatenation of per-sample\ncontigs from the particular dataset. BAM files were sorted using samtools (v.1.14). For all datasets, we used only contigs \u2265 2000 base pairs\n(bp). For long-read benchmarking we used ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard with 1 sample, a human gut microbiome dataset with\n4 samples and a dataset from anaerobic digester sludge with\n3 samples, both sequenced using Pacific Biosciences HiFi technology.\nWe assembled each sample using metaMDBG (v. b55df39), mapped\nreads using minimap2 (v.2.24) with the\u2019-ax map-hifi\u2019 setting, and from\nthere proceeded as with the short reads.\n\n#### Abundances and TNFs\nComputation of abundances and TNFs was done using the VAMB\nmetagenome binning tool. To determine TNFs, tetramer frequencies\nof non-ambiguous bases were calculated for each contig, projected\ninto a 103-dimensional orthonormal space and normalized by z-scaling\neach tetranucleotide across the contigs. To determine the abundances\nof each sample, we used pycoverm (v.0.6.0). The abundances were\nfirst normalized within sample by total number of mapped reads, then\nacross samples to sum to 1. To determine sample-relative abundance,\nthe sum of abundances for a contig was taken before the normalization\nacross samples. The dimensionality of the feature table was then Nc\n\u00d7 (103+Ns + 1) where Nc was the number of contigs, Ns was the number\nof samples.\n\n#### Ground truth labels\nFor the five CAMI2 human microbiome datasets, the provided genomes sequences were classified with GTDB-tk (v.2.4.0) tool which\nresulted in all the contigs annotated to species level with GTDB\n\nidentifiers. Ground truth labels for Marine and Rhizosphere datasets\nwere converted from NCBI to GTDB (v.207) using the gtdb to tax[dump tool (v.0.1.9) available at https://github.com/nick-youngblut/](https://github.com/nick-youngblut/gtdb_to_taxdump)\n[gtdb_to_taxdump (commit hash 24b82d6). Not all NCBI labels had a 1-](https://github.com/nick-youngblut/gtdb_to_taxdump)\nto-1 match in GTDB and not all contigs were annotated in the CAMI2\ndataset to the species level. The resulting number of fully annotated\ncontigs used in the analysis was 208,783 out of 438,686 contigs (48%)\nfor the Marine dataset and 26,734 out of 300,222 contigs (9%) for the\nRhizosphere dataset. We approximated the ground truth taxonomic\nlabels available for the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards\nin the following way. The contigs of each dataset were mapped to the\nprovided reference genomes using NCBI-BLAST (v2.15.0). For each\ncontig, the hit with the highest bit-score was used as the ground\ntruth label.\n\n\n#### Taxonomic classifiers\nWe obtained the taxonomic annotations for contigs of all seven shortread and two long-read datasets from MMseqs2 (v.7e2840), Metabuli\n(v.1.0.1), Centrifuge (v1.0.4) and Kraken2 (v2.1.3). For the long-read\ndataset we also acquired the annotations with MetaMaps (v.633d2e).\nFor MMseqs2, we used the mmseqs taxonomy command. For Metabuli,\nwe used the metabuli classify command with \u2013seq-mode 1 flag. For\nCentrifuge, we used the centrifuge command with -k 1 flag. For Kraken2, we used the kraken command with \u2013minimum-hit-groups 3 flag.\nFor Kraken2 confidence level experiments we ran the the kraken\ncommand with \u2013-confidence-level flags 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0.\nMMseqs2 and Metabuli were configured to use GTDB v207 as the\nreference database. Centrifuge, Kraken2 and MetaMaps were configured to use NCBI identifiers.\n\n#### Network architecture and hyperparameters\nThe input vector of dimensionality Nc \u00d7 (103 + Ns + 1), described in\n\u201cAbundances and TNFs\u201d subsection, was passed through 4 fully connected layers ((103 + Ns + 1) \u00d7 512, 512 \u00d7 512, 512 \u00d7 512, 512 \u00d7 512) with\nleaky ReLU activation function (negative slope 0.01), each using batch\nnormalization (epsilon 1e \u2212 05, momentum 0.1) and dropout (P = 0.2).\nThe output layer had dimensionality 512\u00d7 Nl where Nl was the number\nof leaves in the taxonomic tree (see subsection 4). The output is a\nvector of dimensionality Nl, where Nl is the number of species in the\ntaxonomic tree. The output entries are logits that undergo softmax\ntransformation during the calculation of the hierarchical loss function,\nwhich is described in the next subsection. For all datasets, the network\nwas trained for 100 epochs with batch size 1024 using the Adam\noptimizer with learning rates set via D-Adaptation. The model was\nimplemented using PyTorch (v.1.13.1), and CUDA (v.11.7.99) was used\nwhen running on a V100 GPU.\n\n#### Hierarchical loss\nA taxonomic tree was constructed for each dataset from the taxonomy\nclassifier annotations for the set of contigs. Thus, the resulting taxonomy tree T was a subgraph of a full taxonomy and the space of\npossible predictions was restricted to the taxonomic identities that\nappeared in the search results. We used a flat softmax loss, computed\nin the following way. Let Nl be the number of leaves in the tree T. The\nnetwork outputs the logit vector of dimensionality Nl, where each logit\nrepresents the value for each leaf of the taxonomic tree. The likelihoods of leaf nodes of the taxonomy tree were obtained from the\nsoftmax over the network output vector. The internal nodes of the tree\nare not the part of the output, so the likelihood of an internal node was\nthen a sum of likelihoods of its children and computed recursively\nbottom-up. The complete model output was a vector of likelihoods for\neach possible label, including the internal nodes. For the backpropagation the negative log-likelihood loss was computed for all the\nancestors of the true node and the true node itself. For example, if the\ntrue labels was at the genus level, its likelihood is equal the sum of\nlikelihood of all the species that belong to this genus, and only the\nspecies logits are explicitly the part of the network output vector.\nPredictions were made for all taxonomic levels. For each level, starting\nfrom the root domain level, the node descendant with the highest\nlikelihood was selected and returned as the part of the model\u2019s output\nin a resulting CSV file. If no node descendant had likelihood >0.5, the\npredictions from this level and the levels below were not included in\nthe output.\n\n#### K-fold evaluation\nAll the contigs in a dataset that were annotated by a classifier are\nrandomly divided into five folds. Taxometer was then trained five\ntimes, each time using one fold as a validation set and the remaining\nfour folds as training set. The predictions were made for the five validation sets after training the network on the remaining four. The five\n\n\n-----\n\nvalidation sets were then concatenated to again form the full dataset.\nThis way the prediction for each contig was made without the prior\nknowledge of the classifier annotation of this contig. The F1-score\nmetric that was used to benchmark the classifiers within a dataset was\nthen calculated as following:\n\nTP\nprecision = \u00f01\u00de\n\nTP + FP\n\n\nTP\nrecall = \u00f02\u00de\n\nTP + FP + FN\n\nF1 score = [ \ufffd]precision[precision] +[ \ufffd] recall[recall] \u00f03\u00de\n\nwhere TP (true positives) is the total number of contigs for which the\nTaxometer prediction is the same as the classifier annotation, FP (false\npositives) is the total number of contigs for which the Taxometer\nprediction is different from the classifier annotation and FN (false\nnegatives) is when Taxometer prediction is missing, but the classifier\nannotation exists. For this evaluation, a score threshold of 0.5\nwas used.\n\n#### Reporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\nTheCAMI2 datasets were downloaded from [https://data.cami-](https://data.cami-challenge.org/participate)\n\n[challenge.org/participate from \u201c2nd CAMI Toy Human Microbiome](https://data.cami-challenge.org/participate)\nProjectDataset\u201d (5 human microbiome datasets), \u201c2nd CAMI Challenge\nMarine Dataset\u201d (Marine), \u201c2nd CAMI Challenge Rhizosphere challenge\u201d (Rhizosphere).

Despite e!orts to develop user-friendly platforms, the complexity of these\n\n13 tools continues to hinder e\u201dcient biological data analysis. In this paper, we introduce BioMANIA\u2013\n\n14 an AI-driven, natural language-oriented bioinformatics pipeline that addresses these challenges by\n\n15 enabling the automatic and codeless execution of biological analyses. BioMANIA leverages large\n\n16 language models (LLMs) to interpret user instructions and execute sophisticated bioinformatics work\n17 flows, integrating API knowledge from existing Python tools. By streamlining the analysis process,\n\n18 BioMANIA simplifies complex omics data exploration and accelerates bioinformatics research. Com\n19 pared to relying on general-purpose LLMs to conduct analysis from scratch, BioMANIA, informed by\n\n20 domain-specific biological tools, helps mitigate hallucinations and significantly reduces the likelihood\n\n21 of confusion and errors. Through comprehensive benchmarking and application to diverse biological\n\n22 data, ranging from single-cell omics to electronic health records, we demonstrate BioMANIA\u2019s ability\n\n23 to lower technical barriers, enabling more accurate and comprehensive biological discoveries.\n\n24 **Keywords: Large language models, Chatbots, Single-cell analysis, Electronic health records, Education,**\n\n25 Bioinformatics\n\n26 **1 Introduction**\n\n27 Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to collect vast\n\n28 amounts of omics data\u2014including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics,\n\n29 and microbiomics\u2014across various tissues, organs, individuals, and species. Large-scale consortium\n\n30 projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Weinstein et al, 2013) and the Encyclopedia of\n\n31 DNA Elements (ENCODE) (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012), have made genomic, transcriptomic,\n\n32 and epigenomic data from diverse samples openly accessible. While this wealth of data has sparked\n\n33 interest in understanding molecular mechanisms and exploring therapeutic applications, it also poses\n\n34 significant challenges in extracting meaningful insights from complex data analyses.\n\n35 Over the years, significant e!orts have been made to tackle these data analysis challenges. These\n\n36 e!orts have produced valuable insights from two key perspectives (Zhou et al, 2023): (1) computational\n\n37 researchers develop innovative methods and tools for biological data analysis, and (2) experimental\n\n38 researchers apply existing tools and pipelines to analyze and interpret the data. Initially, bioinformatics\n\n39 tools were developed within specialized programming frameworks, including BioPerl (Stajich et al, 2002),\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\n40 BioRuby (Goto et al, 2010), Bioconductor (Gentleman et al, 2004), Biopython (Cock et al, 2009), and\n\n41 BioJava (Holland et al, 2008). However, utilizing these tools requires considerable bioinformatics pro\n42 gramming expertise, which many experimental researchers may not possess. To lower the programming\n\n43 barrier, more advanced tools were later developed, allowing users to interactively explore and visualize\n\n44 omics data without requiring extensive programming skills. Representative tools include Galaxy (Gia\n45 rdine et al, 2005)\u2013a platform o!ering pre-assembled bioinformatics pipelines for interactive large-scale\n\n46 genome analysis and the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (Cerami et al, 2012), which enables interactive\n\n47 exploration and visualization of preloaded multidimensional cancer genomics datasets, among others.\n\n48 These tools have predefined analyses and often require users to navigate complex interfaces and proce\n49 dures. Additionally, with advancements in algorithms, bioinformatics pipelines evolve rapidly to integrate\n\n50 cutting-edge solutions.\n\n51 Despite the intention to assist experimental researchers, the advancement of bioinformatics tools\n\n52 presents a learning barrier, requiring substantial professional skills and domain-specific expertise. For\n\n53 example, in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, there are over 1,000 tools available\n\n54 (Zappia and Theis, 2021), o!ering diverse computational pipelines, software libraries, and analytical\n\n55 workflows to examine the data from various perspectives. Furthermore, the complexity of scRNA-seq data\n\n56 analysis becomes evident through its multi-step pipeline, which requires substantial specialized knowledge\n\n57 and expertise. The analysis involves numerous considerations (He et al, 2022), including quality control,\n\n58 feature selection, batch correction, dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, cell annotation, trajectory\n\n59 inference, marker gene detection, and more. Completing these steps requires researchers to have both\n\n60 advanced programming skills and a strong biological background, which increases the cost and complexity\n\n61 of conducting single-cell analysis. Thus, there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between researchers\u2019\n\n62 intentions and their understanding of existing bioinformatics tools, facilitating the automatic execution\n\n63 of these tools to produce analysis results for biological data.\n\n64 From a practitioner\u2019s perspective, an ideal bioinformatics framework should lower technical barriers\n\n65 in data analysis for biological scientists by incorporating the following features: (1) standardized and\n\n66 automated pipelines that enable shareable and reproducible analysis (Wratten et al, 2021), and (2)\n\n67 user-friendly, codeless interfaces that help overcome the learning barrier for researchers with limited\n\n68 programming skills (Li et al, 2021). Coincidentally, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 (Brown\n\n69 et al, 2020) and GPT-4 (Bubeck et al, 2023) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural\n\n70 language processing (NLP) tasks, including human-like conversation (Touvron et al, 2023), mathematical\n\n71 reasoning (Wei et al, 2022), code generation (Chen et al, 2021), and more. With the advancement of\n\n72 LLMs, they have increasingly shown potential in utilizing external tools to solve complex problems\n\n73 across various application domains (Qu et al, 2024), much like humans do. For example, in the biological\n\n74 domain, LLMs have proven valuable in bioinformatics education (Shue et al, 2023; Tu et al, 2024) and in\n\n75 assisting with programming tasks (Piccolo et al, 2023; Zhou et al, 2023). Building on these advancements,\n\n76 a natural question arises: \u201cHow can we enable e!ective and user-friendly bioinformatics data analysis\n\n77 using LLMs?\u201d\n\n78 Although leveraging LLMs to assist in bioinformatics data analysis is a promising prospect, directly\n\n79 applying current state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs to specific biological data analysis tasks presents\n\n80 significant challenges. Despite their capabilities in NLP, these general-purpose LLMs lack accurate, up\n81 to-date knowledge of domain-specific biological tools and concepts, often resulting in outputs that lack\n\n82 meaningful biological significance (Qu et al, 2024). A major limitation of general-purpose LLMs is their\n\n83 tendency to \u201challucinate\u201d, generating confident yet inaccurate responses when faced with specialized\n\n84 biological queries (Refer to Sec. A.4 for failure cases). These hallucinated responses can cause confusion\n\n85 and misdirection, making it harder for researchers to achieve their objectives. These limitations highlight\n\n86 the need for tool-specific LLMs that integrate deep, accurate, tool-specific knowledge to enable e\u201dcient,\n\n87 professional, and automated execution of biological data analysis tasks.\n\n88 In this paper, surmount the bioinformatics data analysis barrier using natural languages and pro\n89 pose an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, natural language-oriented bioinformatics data analysis pipeline,\n\n90 named BioMANIA (BioinforMatics dAta aNalysIs through conversAtion), as illustrated in Fig. 1. Bio\n91 MANIA is designed to directly understand natural language instructions from users and e\u201dciently\n\n92 execute complex biological data analysis tasks. Importantly, considering the limitations of LLMs in lack\n\n93 of domain-specific biological knowledge, BioMANIA explicitly learns about API information and their\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n94 interactions from the source code (e.g., hosted in GitHub) and documentation (e.g., hosted in ReadThe\n95 Docs) of any o!-the-shelf well-documented, open-source Python tools. BioMANIA\u2019s innovation enables\n\n96 automated, codeless biological data analysis by simplifying the complex process into manageable steps:\n\n97 interpreting the user\u2019s intent, breaking it down into specific tasks if needed, mapping tasks to API calls,\n\n98 executing the APIs with inferred arguments, and troubleshooting any coding errors. For the purpose\n\n99 of reproducibility, BioMANIA summarizes the execution results in a user-friendly format, organizes the\n\n100 API calls into a downloadable script, and generates a comprehensive report documenting the entire data\n\n101 analysis process. As a result, with minimum human intervention, BioMANIA enables the end-to-end\n\n102 automatic and codeless execution of any o!-the-shelf biological analysis workflow.\n\n103 We have conducted comprehensive evaluation to demonstrate BioMANIA\u2019s empirical utility. We\n\n104 first rigorously benchmarked the performance of each individual step of BioMANIA, using both LLM\n105 generated and human-annotated instructions for hundreds of APIs. Next, we applied BioMANIA to\n\n106 a range of commonly used bioinformatics tools, covering diverse application domains\u2013from single-cell\n\n107 RNA-seq analysis (Wolf et al, 2018), single-cell spatial omics analysis (Palla et al, 2022), single-cell\n\n108 epigenomics analysis (Zhang et al, 2024), to electronic health record analysis (Heumos et al, 2024).\n\n109 Compared to using LLMs to conduct analysis from scratch, which can lead to hallucinated responses\n\n110 and potential misdirection, the structured steps in BioMANIA, informed by domain-specific biological\n\n111 tools, help mitigate hallucinations, significantly reducing the likelihood of confusion and errors. For\n\n112 example, BioMANIA successfully completed 18 out of 21 single-cell transcriptome data analysis tasks,\n\n113 with minimal troubleshooting required for most tasks. In contrast, general-purpose LLMs, when used\n\n114 to perform the analysis from scratch, succeeded in only 5 out of 21 tasks. In summary, BioMANIA\n\n115 simplifies the exploration of omics data and accelerates bioinformatics research and enables more accurate\n\n116 and comprehensive biological discoveries. Also, BioMANIA significantly lowers the technical barriers\n\n117 to conducting state-of-the-art biological data analysis, with the potential to usher in a new research\n\n118 paradigm.\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 1: Overview of BioMANIA. (a) BioMANIA is composed of two main components: the front-**\nend and the back-end. The BioMANIA front-end receives the user\u2019s data and instructions, then sends\nthis information, along with the chat history, to the BioMANIA back-end for intent understanding, task\nplanning, and execution. It then collects the outcomes from the back-end, which include execution results\nwith code and a detailed report. The BioMANIA back-end first learns about API information and their\ninteractions from the source code and documentation of a well-documented, open-source Python tool.\nThe back-end also processes the information received from the front-end, interprets the user\u2019s intent,\nbreaks it down into specific tasks, maps these tasks to API calls, executes the APIs with the inferred\narguments, and sends the execution results back to the front-end. (b) Given the user\u2019s instruction,\nBioMANIA determines their intent in two steps. First, it identifies whether the user is asking an APIspecific data analysis question or engaging in chit-chat. For API-specific questions, it further determines\nwhether the task requires multiple API calls. If multiple API calls are required, BioMANIA breaks the\nuser\u2019s instruction into several tasks and addresses each one individually. (c) BioMANIA analyzes the\nsource code to extract potential APIs, prompts LLMs to understand their functionalities, and generates\nsynthetic instructions corresponding to API calls. These instruction-API pairs are used to train an API\nretriever, which narrows down candidate APIs to the top-k for a given instruction, and an API predictor,\nwhich selects the exact API from the retrieved subset. (d) BioMANIA uses a Python interpreter to\nexecute the predicted API calls. In case of failure, BioMANIA gathers all relevant error information and\nprompts LLMs to troubleshoot and iteratively revise the API call code.\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n119 **2 Results**\n\n120 **2.1 The design of Python tools influence the e!ectiveness of conversational**\n\n121 **data analysis**\n\n**Fig. 2: The design and implementation of Python tools influence the e!ectiveness of con-**\n**versational data analysis. (a) The Python tools used by BioMANIA display varying levels of API**\nambiguity, validity, tutorial and unit-test coverage, argument distribution, tutorial comprehensiveness,\nand Git support. (b) The common issues encountered by BioMANIA are categorized into four groups,\neach based on their role in the BioMANIA pipeline. A concise description is provided for each issue,\nalong with the indication of its presence or absence in each Python tool. (c) The major issues are illustrated with real examples we encountered in the Python tool Scanpy.\n\n122 BioMANIA is designed to enable conversational, codeless analysis for any o!-the-shelf Python tools.\n\n123 However, it\u2019s important to recognize that these tools were not originally designed for conversational\n\n124 analysis. This raises a natural question: \u201cWhat are the challenges in making existing tools suitable for\n\n125 conversational analysis?\u201d To assess how the design and implementation of existing Python tools impact\n\n126 the e!ectiveness of conversational data analysis, we gathered a variety of commonly used bioinformatics\n\n127 tools, spanning diverse application domains such as single-cell omics analysis and electronic health records\n\n128 (Refer to Sec. 4.2 for more details). These Python tools used by BioMANIA exhibit varying levels of API\n\n129 ambiguity, validity, tutorial and unit-test coverage, argument distribution, tutorial comprehensiveness,\n\n130 and Git support, reflecting a wide range of complexity (Fig. 2a).\n\n131 During our analysis of these tools, we identified 19 common issues encountered throughout the BioMA\n132 NIA pipeline. These issues were categorized into four groups based on their role (Fig. 2b). We break down\n\n133 the issue categories and discuss each one in the order it occurs within the BioMANIA analysis pipeline. We\n\n134 observed that some tools could not be installed smoothly by following the documentation instructions. For\n\n135 example, the Python tool Squidpy v1.3.0 is incompatible with versions of the dependency library Napari\n\n136 [earlier than v0.4,as confirmed by its Github issue (https://github.com/scverse/squidpy/issues/743).](https://github.com/scverse/squidpy/issues/743)\n\n137 We observed that many issues stem from the Python tool\u2019s code, which are critical for BioMANIA\n\n138 tool parsing. These code-related issues encompass various aspects of code design and implementation,\n\n139 including API design, argument structure, and usage guidance. In the API design, some APIs either\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n140 share identical function names or have nearly identical descriptions, making them di\u201dcult to distinguish\n\n141 and use correctly. For example, the Python tool Scanpy has three nearly identical APIs related to\n\n142 principal component analysis, i.e., \u201cscanpy.pp.pca\u201d, \u201cscanpy.pl.pca\u201d, and \u201cscanpy.tl.pca\u201d, di!ering by\n\n143 only one edit distance. As a result, improper API design can hinder e!ective API shortlisting and\n\n144 prediction from user instructions (Refer to Sec. 2.2 for more details). In terms of argument design, some\n\n145 tools feature highly complex APIs with up to dozens of arguments, which can overwhelm the argument\n\n146 prediction process and make conversational analysis more laborious. For example, Scanpy has an API\n\n147 called \u201cscanpy.pl.spatial\u201d for scatter plots in spatial coordinates, which has a total of 56 arguments,\n\n148 most of which are optional (Fig. 2c). As a result, the excessive number of arguments poses challenges for\n\n149 BioMANIA, as most of them are not demonstrated through unit tests or tutorials. Even Scanpy, which\n\n150 has the highest argument coverage, only manages to cover 21.4% of argument usage (Fig. 2a).\n\n151 Apart from code issues, documentation-related problems further exacerbate the challenges in BioMA\n152 NIA tool parsing. Although documentation is expected to provide detailed information about API usage,\n\n153 inaccuracies and complications in the documentation can adversely a!ect its e!ectiveness. However, we\n\n154 observed that some tools lack up-to-date documentation, listing APIs that have already been depre\n155 cated (Fig. 2c). This inconsistency between the documentation and the code leads to confusion when\n\n156 parsing the tool for conversational analysis. Furthermore, we consider tutorials to be valuable resources\n\n157 for demonstrating the interplay among APIs, o!ering guidance on how to coordinate multiple APIs to\n\n158 complete real-world tasks. However, we observed that some tutorials are overly complicated, making it\n\n159 di\u201dcult for BioMANIA to e!ectively capture the interplay among APIs. For example, some tutorials are\n\n160 designed to be interactive (e.g., The CellProfiler tutorial in Squidpy), requiring user input within loops\n\n161 to run correctly, which disrupts the automated process of BioMANIA. Additionally, some tutorials follow\n\n162 software engineering principles by encapsulating multiple APIs within a wrapper function for repetitive\n\n163 use, making them more di\u201dcult to analyze (Fig. 2c).\n\n164 Lastly, BioMANIA leverages LLMs for predicting APIs and arguments (Fig.1), but the use of LLMs\n\n165 inevitably leads to occasional hallucinations, where confident yet inaccurate responses are generated.\n\n166 For example, LLMs may suggest APIs that don\u2019t exist or generate irrelevant, even nonsensical, argu\n167 ments based on the user\u2019s instruction (Fig. 2b). Although hallucinated responses are inevitable when\n\n168 using LLMs, having the detailed descriptions of APIs and arguments can help easily identify these\n\n169 hallucinations, thereby reducing potential confusion and misdirection.\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n170 **2.2 BioMANIA accurately manages each step in its pipeline**\n\n**Fig. 3: Evaluating the e!ectiveness of BioMANIA in each of its key components. (a) Bio-**\nMANIA accurately di!erentiates between chit-chat samples and API-encoded instructions generated by\nLLMs across di!erent Python tools. The performance is further supported qualitatively by the clear separation observed in the t-SNE projection. (b) BioMANIA accurately distinguishes between instructions\nthat encode a single API and those that encode multiple APIs across di!erent Python tools. The cosine\nsimilarity of the top-ranked matches reported by the API retriever, the top-3 in particular, reveals a\nsignificant disparity between instructions encoding a single API and those encoding multiple APIs. (c)\nBioMANIA uses a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT-based API retriever to accurately identify the top three\ncandidate APIs containing the target, outperforming two baselines: BM25 and Sentence-BERT without\nfine-tuning. (d) BioMANIA frames API prediction as an in-context API selection task and outperforms other baselines in terms of accuracy, including alternative problem formulations (e.g., multi-label\nclassification or sequence generation) and di!erent LLM choices (e.g., GPT-3.5). (e) Here, we provide\nillustrative examples of synthetic instructions generated by LLMs for a randomly selected API, along\nwith API retrieval and prediction for a randomly selected user instruction. (f ) BioMANIA categorizes\nargument prediction into three groups based on argument type. (g) Each argument type is exemplified by\na randomly selected example. (h) BioMANIA accurately predicts arguments of di!erent types, achieving\nhigh true positive and true negative rates.\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\n171 BioMANIA relies on several key components to enable automated, codeless biological data analysis. That\n\n172 said, the e!ectiveness of BioMANIA critically depends on these components working together seamlessly\n\n173 and e\u201dciently. Thus, we break down the BioMANIA pipeline and assess the e!ectiveness of BioMANIA\n\n174 in each of its key components, which contribute at di!erent stages of the pipeline.\n\n175 We first investigated BioMANIA\u2019s performance in distinguishing between user queries related to API\n176 encoded instructions and casual chit-chat (Refer to Sec. 4.1.2 for more details). We randomly sampled\n\n177 an equal number of chit-chat samples from two existing chit-chat datasets: Topical-Chat (Gopalakr\n178 ishnan et al, 2019) and Qnamaker (Agrawal et al, 2020). Qualitatively, the t-SNE projection reveals a\n\n179 clear separation between TF-IDF embeddings of chit-chat samples from two datasets and API-encoded\n\n180 instructions generated by LLMs (Fig. 3a). Quantitatively, this clear separation enables a simple nearest\n\n181 centroid classifier to achieve nearly perfect classification accuracy on the test dataset, with a minimum\n\n182 accuracy of 99.19% across di!erent Python tools. The accurate recognition of chit-chat samples allows\n\n183 BioMANIA to better interpret the user\u2019s intent and decide whether to proceed with determining the\n\n184 corresponding API calls.\n\n185 We next investigated BioMANIA\u2019s performance distinguishes between instructions that encode a\n\n186 single API and those that encode multiple APIs (Refer to Sec. 4.1.3 for more details). We generated\n\n187 two population of API-encoded instructions: one consisting of concatenated instructions encoding the\n\n188 same API generated by LLMs, and the other consisting of concatenated instructions encoding multiple\n\n189 di!erent APIs generated by LLMs. Qualitatively, the cosine similarity of the top-ranked matches reported\n\n190 by the API retriever reveals a significant disparity between instructions encoding a single API and those\n\n191 encoding multiple APIs (Fig. 3b). By fitting a multivariate Gaussian model using the cosine similarity\n\n192 values of the top-3 matches reported by the API retriever for each instruction population, the model\n\n193 accurately distinguishes between instructions that encode a single API and those that encode multiple\n\n194 APIs. This approach achieves accuracies of 86.14%, 82.93%, 90.50%, and 89.62% across four di!erent\n\n195 Python tools, respectively. Accurate classification of planning necessity enables BioMANIA to better\n\n196 interpret the user\u2019s intent and determine whether the task requires multiple API calls.\n\n197 After initiating an API call, we evaluated BioMANIA\u2019s performance in shortlisting the top three\n\n198 candidate APIs that contain the target (Refer to Sec. 4.1.4 for more details). BioMANIA employs a fine\n199 tuned Sentence-BERT-based API retriever (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) for shortlisting. We evaluated\n\n200 its performance by comparing it to two baseline methods: Sentence-BERT without fine-tuning and BM25,\n\n201 (Robertson et al, 2009), a commonly used deterministic relevance measure for document comparison.\n\n202 To assess whether the synthesized instructions generated by the LLMs accurately mimic the user\u2019s\n\n203 instructions, we used two test datasets: one with synthesized instructions generated by the LLM and the\n\n204 other manually labeled by a diverse group of human annotators (Refer to Sec. 4.3 for more details). The\n\n205 fine-tuned API retriever achieves an average accuracy of 97.50% for synthetic instructions and 95.61%\n\n206 for human-annotated instructions in shortlisting the target API within the top three candidates across\n\n207 di!erent Python tools (Fig. 3c). The slightly lower performance with human-annotated instructions is\n\n208 expected, as the test synthetic instructions were generated by GPT-4, which was also used during training.\n\n209 In contrast, Sentence-BERT without fine-tuning and BM25, two baseline methods that lack access to\n\n210 training data, achieve average accuracies of 85.84% and 80.98% for synthetic instructions, and 86.74%\n\n211 and 70.32% for human-annotated instructions, respectively. It is important to note that improper API\n\n212 design can hinder e!ective API shortlisting, with a significant portion of misclassifications attributed to\n\n213 the presence of ambiguously designed APIs (Refer to Sec. 2.1 for more details). By focusing on target\n\n214 APIs without ambiguity, the fine-tuned API retriever achieves an increased average accuracy of 99.47%\n\n215 for synthetic instructions and 98.40% for human-annotated instructions.\n\n216 With the shortlisted APIs from the API retriever, we evaluated BioMANIA\u2019s performance in pre\n217 dicting the target API from the shortlist (Refer to Sec. 4.1.5 for more details). We assessed prediction\n\n218 performance across multiple settings, considering factors such as the use of LLMs for prediction, the\n\n219 inclusion of the API Retriever, the formulation of the problem as either a prediction task or a sequence\n\n220 generation task (i.e., generating the API from scratch), and the choice between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (Fig.\n\n221 3d). The in-context API classification model based on GPT-4 achieves an average accuracy of 92.64%\n\n222 for synthetic instructions and 92.70% for human-annotated instructions when predicting the target API\n\n223 from the top three candidates across di!erent Python tools. After excluding ambiguous APIs, the average\n\n224 accuracy improves to 94.11% for synthetic instructions and 94.36% for human-annotated instructions.\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n225 Refer to Fig. 3e for illustrative examples of API retrieval and prediction given a user instruction. Fur\n226 thermore, we observed that: (1) Utilizing the LLM for prediction significantly outperforms multi-label\n\n227 classification; (2) Framing the problem as a prediction task yields better results compared to formulat\n228 ing it as a sequence generation task; (3) Employing the API Retriever helps filter out incorrect answers,\n\n229 thereby improving prediction accuracy; and (4) GPT-4 better comprehends in-context demonstrations\n\n230 and predicts the target API more e!ectively than GPT-3.5.\n\n231 Lastly, we evaluated BioMANIA\u2019s performance in predicting the argument values based on the pre\n232 dicted API call (Refer to Sec. 4.1.6 for more details). To prevent the generation of confidently incorrect\n\n233 or incompatible values for API calls, we categorize argument prediction into three groups based on\n\n234 argument type (Fig. 3e): Literal, Bool, and other types. We quantified the argument prediction perfor\n235 mance using two metrics: the Area Under the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the True Negative Rate\n\n236 (TNR). A high TPR reflects better sensitivity in predicting the desired argument, while a high TNR indi\n237 cates stronger resistance against hallucinations. As a result, BioMANIA achieves an average accuracy of\n\n238 97.24%, 89.57%, and 89.90% for TPR, and 78.47%, 81.91%, and 94.77% for TNR across di!erent Python\n\n239 tools, respectively. These results suggest potential areas for improvement in future work, particularly in\n\n240 reducing LLM hallucinations.\n\n241 It is important to note that while BioMANIA performs e!ectively across its key components, it is\n\n242 not without flaws, and errors at each stage of the pipeline may accumulate. To prevent these errors from\n\n243 compounding into major issues, BioMANIA, though designed to operate autonomously, still involves\n\n244 the user in the process. Users are encouraged to monitor task progression and actively interact with\n\n245 BioMANIA, fostering a collaborative approach.\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\n246 **2.3 BioMANIA enables conversational single-cell transcriptome data analysis**\n\n\n#### a\n\n b\n\n\nTask success/failure\n\n|Task success/failure c Success w/o troubleshooting Success w/ single troubleshooting Success w/ multiple troubleshooting Failure after multiple troubleshooting Number of tasks Dataset loading Dimension reduction Welcome to BioMANIA!

(a) BioMANIA successfully completed 18 out of 21 single-cell transcriptome data analysis tasks**\nusing Scanpy, with most tasks requiring little to no troubleshooting. (b) Successfully tasks accomplished\nby BioMANIA without any troubleshooting. (c) Successfully tasks accomplished by BioMANIA with\ntroubleshooting. (d) BioMANIA is capable of task planning and decomposition, as demonstrated in a\ncase study of single-cell clustering analysis.\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n247 To assess the e!ectiveness of BioMANIA in real-world conversational data analysis, we began by exam\n248 ining single-cell gene expression data using the widely-adopted tool, Scanpy (Wolf et al, 2018). Scanpy\n\n249 [(https://scanpy.readthedocs.io) is a widely-used toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io)\n\n250 across a range of functionalities (Refer to Sec. 4.2 for more details). We gathered 21 representative single\n251 cell transcriptome data analysis tasks from Scanpy, covering a broad range of functionalities including\n\n252 data loading, preprocessing, quality control, dimensionality reduction, summary statistics, gene ranking,\n\n253 and various visualization techniques (Refer to Fig. A.7 for more details). Among these tasks, BioMANIA\n\n254 successfully completed 18 out of 21 using Scanpy, with the majority of tasks requiring minimal or no\n\n255 troubleshooting (Fig. 4a). In contrast, general-purpose LLMs, when used to perform the analysis from\n\n256 scratch, succeeded in only 5 out of 21 tasks (Refer to Sec. A.4 for more details).\n\n257 At the start of the analysis, users can either upload their own datasets in the input area and instruct\n\n258 BioMANIA to parse them, or quickly load built-in datasets for a proof-of-principle analysis. After receiv\n259 ing instructions from users, BioMANIA lists the top three potential API candidates, each accompanied\n\n260 by a concise summary and the relevance score between the API and the input instruction, as determined\n\n261 by the fine-tuned API retriever. After predicting the target API from the shortlist, BioMANIA provides\n\n262 a summary based on the API information, explaining how the predicted API could address the user\u2019s\n\n263 request and fulfill their needs. Once the target API and required arguments are identified, BioMANIA\n\n264 generates the corresponding code, including necessary library imports, and executes the API call using a\n\n265 built-in Python interpreter. After the API\u2019s success execution, BioMANIA construct comprehensive nat\n266 ural language-based responses from three perspectives: (1) A step-by-step code explanation to illustrate\n\n267 each component for educational purposes, from the argument settings to the output; (2) The execution\n\n268 results in a user-friendly format, like a plotting figure or a snapshot of the data matrix; and (3) The API\n\n269 calls organized into a downloadable script for reproducibility, allowing users to customize the script and\n\n270 re-run it as needed. For example, BioMANIA can be instructed to load a processed 3k PBMC dataset\n\n271 from 10x Genomics and visualize the cells using t-SNE projection (Fig. 4b).\n\n272 It\u2019s important to note that BioMANIA cannot be guaranteed to be flawless, and errors may occur\n\n273 during API calls due to various reasons, such as incorrect formatting of input arguments or missing\n\n274 dependencies. When errors are encountered during code execution, BioMANIA refines the API calling\n\n275 code by gathering all relevant error information and prompting LLMs to troubleshoot and iteratively\n\n276 revise the code. For example, through troubleshooting, BioMANIA can pinpoint the erroneous argument\n\n277 needed for calculating Moran\u2019s I Global Autocorrelation Statistic. For another example, it can identify\n\n278 that the root cause of a Key Error in plotting a trajectory-related PAGA graph (Wolf et al, 2019) lies in\n\n279 the missing invocation of dependent functions (Fig. 4c). While troubleshooting can help mitigate errors\n\n280 that occur during API calls, there remains a possibility that some issues may not be resolved e!ectively\n\n281 (Refer to Fig. A.7 for more details). Among the failed tasks, one involved creating a visual representation\n\n282 of pseudotime data using the \u201cscanpy.pl.dpt groups pseudotime\u201d function. The task encountered a Key\n\n283 Error due to missing dependencies. However, the challenge arose from the large number of prerequisite\n\n284 APIs that needed to be executed beforehand, and at times, the error messages were not informative\n\n285 enough to pinpoint the exact missing API call within the specified retry attempts. The other failed\n\n286 task involved annotating the genes with the most variation using the \u201cscanpy.pp.highly variable genes\u201d\n\n287 function. Unfortunately, this task encountered a Key Error, and the error message provided little helpful\n\n288 [information. The issue remains unresolved and is currently an open GitHub issue (https://github.com/](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2853)\n\n289 [scverse/scanpy/issues/2853).](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2853)\n\n290 Lastly, when the user provides a relatively vague instruction, BioMANIA is capable of understanding\n\n291 the user\u2019s needs and breaking down the instruction into several tasks, addressing each one individually.\n\n292 For example, the user might vaguely request a clustering analysis on the data without specifying the exact\n\n293 strategy. BioMANIA can be prompted to break down the request into six sequential sub-tasks (Fig. 4d):\n\n294 (1) Load a built-in dataset; (2) Filter dataset to remove low-quality cells and genes; (3) Normalize the\n\n295 dataset to account for varying sequencing depths; (4) Compute the neighborhood graph to understand\n\n296 the relationships between data points in the dataset; (5) Perform Louvain clustering on the computed\n\n297 neighborhood graph; and (6) Visualize the Louvain clustering results with a scatter plot. The planned\n\n298 sub-tasks encompass the entire data analysis pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, analysis,\n\n299 and visualization. Importantly, each sub-task is concrete and can be addressed sequentially through\n\n300 individual API calls. Refer to Fig. A.8 for more examples of single-cell transcriptome data task planning.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\n301 **2.4 BioMANIA empowers conversational analysis across much broader**\n\n302 **domains**\n\n\n**a** Dataset loading (seqFISH) Dataset loading (IMC) **b** Ripley's statistics\n\n\n**c**\n\n|a Dataset loading (seqFISH) Dataset loading (IMC) Welcome to BioMANIA!

We next\n\n305 examined the e!ectiveness of BioMANIA in analyzing single-cell spatial omics data using a widely\n306 [adopted tool, Squidpy (Palla et al, 2022). Squidpy (https://squidpy.readthedocs.io) is a widely-used](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io)\n\n307 toolkit for analyzing single-cell spatial omics data (Refer to Sec. 4.2 for more details). We demonstrated\n\n308 the usefulness of BioMANIA in six representative single-cell spatial omics data analysis tasks, encom\n309 passing a broad range of functionalities, including data loading, Ripley\u2019s statistics for spatial pattern\n\n310 analysis, co-occurrence probability of clusters, centrality scores for di!erent cell types, neighborhood\n\n311 enrichment analysis, and cluster interaction analysis (Fig. 5). Since Squidpy separates data analysis from\n\n312 visualization, the six selected tasks e!ectively involve 12 API calls in total. These showcases present\n\n313 a new representative scenario where additional argument information is required, highlighting BioMA\n314 NIA\u2019s ability to handle such requests e!ectively. For example, one task involved plotting the centrality\n\n315 scores for di!erent cell types, but the user neglected to mention the key that stores the cell type infor\n316 mation in the conversation. BioMANIA accurately predicts the target API for plotting centrality scores\n\n317 but encounters an issue due to the absence of the key name that holds the cell type information. As a\n\n318 result, BioMANIA explains to the user what is needed to proceed and requests the additional argument\n\n319 information necessary for execution.\n\n320 In addition to single-cell spatial omics data analysis, We also examined the e!ectiveness of BioMA\n321 NIA in analyzing single-cell epigenomics data using a widely-adopted tool, SnapATAC2 (Zhang et al,\n\n322 [2024). SnapATAC2 (https://kzhang.org/SnapATAC2) is a widely-used toolkit for single-cell epigenomics](https://kzhang.org/SnapATAC2)\n\n323 analysis especially for single-cell ATAC-seq data (Refer to Sec. 4.2 for more details). We showcased the\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n324 utility of BioMANIA in a lengthy yet commonly used pipeline for identifying enriched transcription fac\n325 tor (TF) motifs. This TF motif enrichment identification pipeline consists of several key tasks, including\n\n326 data loading, peak calling, peak merging, peak counting, marker region identification, TF motif retrieval,\n\n327 and TF motif enrichment analysis (Fig. 6). As a result, BioMANIA produces visualized motif enrichment\n\n328 results, aiding in the identification of crucial enriched motifs in the input data while maintaining a low\n\n329 false discovery rate.\n\n330 Lastly, BioMANIA is applicable beyond the single-cell domain. We demonstrated its utility in elec\n331 tronic health record data analysis, showcasing a variety of tasks that encompass a broad range of\n\n332 functionalities, including data loading, missing value visualization, missing value imputation, and sur\n333 vival analysis. Refer to Fig. A.9 for more details of using Ehrapy (Heumos et al, 2024) for conversational\n\n334 electronic health record data analysis.\n\n335 **3 Discussion**\n\n336 In this study, we aim to bridge the learning barriers in data analysis for biological scientists, addressing\n\n337 the need for substantial technical skills and domain-specific expertise. For this purpose, we propose Bio\n338 MANIA, an AI-driven, natural language-oriented bioinformatics data analysis pipeline that facilitates\n\n339 the automatic execution of o!-the-shelf Python-based bioinformatics tools, enabling the generation of\n\n340 analysis results for biological data with minimal tool-specific knowledge and coding expertise required.\n\n341 The key novelties of BioMANIA lie in its design, where BioMANIA explicitly learns about API infor\n342 mation and their interactions directly from the source code and documentation of any well-documented,\n\n343 open-source Python tools. This allows for a deeper, more accurate understanding of the tools\u2019 func\n344 tionalities, enabling seamless integration into the conversational analysis pipeline. BioMANIA follows\n\n345 a rigorous and comprehensively validated process: interpreting the user\u2019s intent, breaking it down into\n\n346 specific tasks when necessary, mapping these tasks to API calls, executing the APIs with inferred argu\n347 ments, and troubleshooting any coding errors encountered during execution. Compared to using LLMs\n\n348 to conduct analysis from scratch, which can lead to hallucinated responses and potential misdirection,\n\n349 the structured steps in BioMANIA help mitigate hallucinations, significantly reducing the likelihood of\n\n350 confusion and errors. This approach ensures a more reliable and accurate data analysis process.\n\n351 Traditionally, LLM-driven bioinformatics data analysis tools are specialized and designed for prede\n352 fined tasks, lacking the flexibility to easily extend to new, unseen application domains (Li et al, 2021;\n\n353 Xiao et al, 2024). This rigid structure limits their adaptability, making it challenging to apply them to\n\n354 emerging datasets, novel analytical methods, or other areas that require dynamic adjustments beyond\n\n355 their original design. This contrasts with approaches like BioMANIA, which o!er more versatility by\n\n356 leveraging open-source Python tools and adapting dynamically to user queries across diverse domains.\n\n357 In this way, our approach provides a path toward end-to-end automatic and codeless execution of any\n\n358 o!-the-shelf biological analysis workflow. Furthermore, BioMANIA takes full consideration of the goals\n\n359 of reproducibility and education. It provides user-friendly, detailed descriptions for each step of the anal\n360 ysis, ensuring that users understand the reasoning behind every API call. BioMANIA organizes these\n\n361 API calls into a downloadable script for easy reuse, o!ers step-by-step explanations of the code, and\n\n362 generates a comprehensive report documenting the entire data analysis process. This approach not only\n\n363 ensures transparency and reproducibility but also serves as an educational tool, helping users to better\n\n364 understand and learn from the analysis. We have conducted comprehensive evaluation to demonstrate\n\n365 BioMANIA\u2019s empirical utility. we applied BioMANIA to a range of commonly used bioinformatics tools,\n\n366 covering diverse application domains\u2013from single-cell RNA-seq analysis (Wolf et al, 2018), single-cell spa\n367 tial omics analysis (Palla et al, 2022), single-cell epigenomics analysis (Zhang et al, 2024), to electronic\n\n368 health record analysis (Heumos et al, 2024).\n\n369 Lastly, this study highlights several promising directions for future research. First of all, we recog\n370 nize that o!-the-shelf Python tools were not originally designed for conversational analysis. The Python\n\n371 tools used by BioMANIA exhibit varying levels of API design ambiguity, validity, and complexity, which\n\n372 are demonstrated to influence the e!ectiveness of conversational data analysis. These factors can lead\n\n373 to challenges such as ambiguous function names, excessive and poorly documented parameters, or out\n374 dated documentation, all of which can hinder accurate API prediction, argument selection, and overall\n\n375 performance of the conversational interface. This limitation highlights an area for future development.\n\n376 For example, BioMANIA currently employs a static Abstract Syntax Tree parser to analyze source code\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n377 and extract potential APIs. While this approach helps identify individual APIs and their arguments,\n\n378 it primarily focuses on static code analysis. It would be interesting to employ a dynamic parser, which\n\n379 could analyze runtime behavior and the interplay among APIs. This would enable BioMANIA to aggre\n380 gate multiple APIs into higher-level functionalities that align more closely with the user\u2019s needs, o!ering\n\n381 a more seamless and intuitive data analysis experience. Secondly, BioMANIA currently o!ers a prelim\n382 inary task planning step to decompose the user\u2019s instruction into several tasks and address each one\n\n383 individually. However, this approach implicitly assumes that the user has some knowledge of the scope\n\n384 and capabilities of the Python tool being used, providing only a vague description of their needs. This\n\n385 di!ers from the scenario of engaging with unknown data for data-driven scientific discovery, where the\n\n386 user\u2019s expectations might be less defined. For future development, it would be interesting to build a pool\n\n387 of specialized chatbots, with each chatbot representing a di!erent Python tool and deeply understand\n388 ing its capabilities. A more powerful, overarching planner could then coordinate these chatbots, enabling\n\n389 them to work together to better explore the data, identify patterns, and make scientific discoveries. This\n\n390 system would o!er a more dynamic, multi-tool approach, leveraging the strength of each tool to guide\n\n391 the user through more complex analyses and discoveries, even with unknown datasets.\n\n392 Existing Python tools passively analyze the provided data and perform their predefined function\n393 alities. However, in many cases, researchers face the challenge of insu\u201dcient data, as generating data\n\n394 through experiments can be costly and time-consuming (Huang et al, 2024). From the practitioner\u2019s per\n395 spective, it would be highly beneficial to develop an agent capable of actively exploring the data that\n\n396 has been acquired so far. This agent could reverse the process by guiding optimal experimental design to\n\n397 generate better, more informative data. By incorporating both data generation and analysis within the\n\n398 same feedback loop, such an agent could assist in designing more e\u201dcient experiments that maximize the\n\n399 insights gained from minimal data. This integration would empower practitioners to not only analyze\n\n400 but also proactively plan for future data collection, leading to more targeted, cost-e!ective, and scien\n401 tifically valuable experimental designs. Combining data generation, analysis, and experimental planning\n\n402 would create a unified system for comprehensive data-driven research.\n\n403 In conclusion,BioMANIA simplifies the exploration of omics data and accelerates bioinformatics\n\n404 research and enables more accurate and comprehensive biological discoveries. Also, BioMANIA signif\n405 icantly lowers the technical barriers to conducting state-of-the-art biological data analysis, with the\n\n406 potential to usher in a new research paradigm. We anticipate that BioMANIA will reshape the landscape\n\n407 of bioinformatics research, enhancing data analysis accessibility and expediting discoveries in the field.\n\n408 **4 Methods**\n\n409 **4.1 The key components of BioMANIA**\n\n410 BioMANIA relies on several key components to enable automated, codeless biological data analysis (Fig.\n\n411 1). Through the front-end chatbot interface, these components work together e!ectively and seamlessly\n\n412 to interpret the user\u2019s intent, plan analysis tasks, translate them into specific API calls with concrete\n\n413 arguments, and execute the tasks while troubleshooting any runtime errors.\n\n414 **4.1.1 Tool parsing**\n\n415 BioMANIA is designed to directly use natural language to perform complex biological data analysis,\n\n416 leveraging existing software libraries and workflows to accomplish these tasks. To achieve this goal, Bio\n417 MANIA explicitly learns API information and their interactions from the source code (e.g., hosted in\n\n418 GitHub) and documentation (e.g., hosted in ReadTheDocs) of any o!-the-shelf well-documented, open\n419 source Python tools. Specifically, BioMANIA employs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser to analyze\n\n420 the source code and extract potential APIs. For each API, we further extract key details, including\n\n421 its requirements (argument list), operations (name, description), and return values, to ensure its e!ec\n422 tive utilization. Arguments can be either required or optional, with each having an argument name,\n\n423 description, data type, and, for optional arguments, a default value.\n\n424 Source code analysis often yields a large number of APIs with varying quality and reliability. BioMA\n425 NIA employs a rigorous filtering process to remove low-quality and unreliable APIs from direct source\n\n426 code analysis. We start by removing APIs that lack documentation, are not executable, or are deprecated\n\n427 Furthermore, BioMANIA cross-compares the curated list of APIs from the tool\u2019s documentation with\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\n428 those identified from the source code, retaining only the APIs that appear in both. Finally, BioMANIA\n\n429 double-checks the remaining APIs by testing their functionalities to ensure they are fully operational.\n\n430 **4.1.2 Chit-chat recognition**\n\n431 Based on the user\u2019s instruction, BioMANIA determines their intent by assessing whether they are ask\n432 ing an API-specific data analysis question. In natural conversation, a significant portion of the dialogue\n\n433 does not convey user intent \u2013 instead, it consists of greetings or remarks that do not request information\n\n434 or program execution (Stewart et al, 2006). Consequently, we incorporate a chit-chat detection stage to\n\n435 determine whether the user is inquiring about API-based data analysis or simply engaging in casual con\n436 versation. To di!erentiate between API calls and casual conversation, we compile a substantial corpus of\n\n437 open-domain conversational samples from two existing chit-chat datasets: Topical-Chat (Gopalakrishnan\n\n438 et al, 2019) and Qnamaker (Agrawal et al, 2020). These two datasets complement each other, with the\n\n439 Topical-Chat dataset covering across di!erent topics (e.g., Sports, Music, Science and Technology, etc.)\n\n440 and the Qnamaker dataset focusing on various personalities (e.g., enthusiastic, professional, witty, etc.).\n\n441 The goal of chit-chat detection is to di!erentiate between chit-chat samples and API-encoded instruc\n442 tions generated by LLMs. Specifically, we represent both chit-chat samples and API-encoded instructions\n\n443 as TF-IDF embeddings (Ramos, 2003). This process involves vectorizing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency\n444 Inverse Document Frequency) scores, a widely used metric for determining word importance, for each\n\n445 word in the dictionary. We calculate the centroids for three groups (i.e., API-encoded instructions,\n\n446 Topical-Chat samples, and Qnamaker samples) and use these to build a nearest centroid classifier for\n\n447 chit-chat detection. For a new user instruction, we compute the cosine similarity between its TF-IDF\n\n448 embedding and these centroids, predicting the label based on the closest centroid. Despite its simplicity,\n\n449 we found that the nearest centroid classifier performs both accurately and e\u201dciently in practice (Refer\n\n450 to Fig. A.2 for more details). Finally, chit-chat detection leads to one of two outcomes: either providing\n\n451 a chit-chat response or recognizing the API from the question. Accordingly, the chatbot will either use\n\n452 an LLM to engage with users or proceed to determine the corresponding API calls (Fig. 1b).\n\n453 **4.1.3 Task planning**\n\n454 If the user is asking an API-specific data analysis question, BioMANIA further evaluates whether the\n\n455 task requires multiple API calls. We frame the assessment of whether multiple API calls are required as\n\n456 a binary classification problem. To achieve this, we generate two populations of API-encoded instruc\n457 tions: one consisting of concatenated instructions encoding the same API generated by LLMs, and the\n\n458 other consisting of concatenated instructions encoding multiple di!erent APIs generated by LLMs. Since\n\n459 concatenated instructions are generally longer than single instructions, we use LLMs to shorten them\n\n460 to prevent instruction length from becoming a confounding factor. Each concatenated instruction, from\n\n461 either population, is searched against an API retriever, which encodes the instruction and API documen\n462 tation (including its name, description, and argument list) as embeddings (Refer to Sec. 4.1.4 for more\n\n463 details). The relevance between the instruction and API is determined by the cosine similarity between\n\n464 the two embeddings. We observed that the cosine similarity of the top-ranked matches reported by the\n\n465 API retriever reveals a significant disparity between instructions encoding a single API and those encod\n466 ing multiple APIs (Refer to Fig. A.3 for more details). Following this observation, we fit a multivariate\n\n467 Gaussian model using the cosine similarity values of the top-3 matches reported by the API retriever for\n\n468 each instruction population. For a new user instruction, we search it against the API retriever, obtain the\n\n469 cosine similarity values of the top matches, compute the probability under both fitted Gaussian models,\n\n470 and determine the necessity of multiple API calls based on which model having a higher probability.\n\n471 If multiple API calls are required, BioMANIA breaks the user\u2019s instruction into several tasks and\n\n472 addresses each one individually. Due to the inherent dependencies among certain tasks, the execution\n\n473 sequence of the decomposed tasks must be considered to establish interconnections between the tasks\n\n474 e!ectively. We provide the following information as part of the prompt to the LLMs: (1) A description of\n\n475 the task goal, including details about the input data and the desired output format; (2) The complexity\n\n476 and scope of each subtask; and (3) Guidelines for describing the subtasks. Based on the LLM\u2019s built-in\n\n477 knowledge and the descriptions provided for task planning, the LLM intelligently understands the user\u2019s\n\n478 instruction and breaks it into a sequence of tasks, while considering task dependencies. Detailed prompts\n\n479 for task planning, including examples, can be found in Sec. A.5.1.\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\n480 **4.1.4 API shortlisting**\n\n481 After planning, BioMANIA aims to complete all the tasks sequentially by translating each task into\n\n482 the corresponding API call. However, predicting the most suitable API from the user\u2019s instruction is\n\n483 challenging because real-world bioinformatics tools often have a vast number of API candidates. This\n\n484 makes it impractical to include descriptions of all APIs as input for LLMs due to token length and cost\n\n485 constraints. To address this issue, we implement an API shortlisting process by using an API retriever\n\n486 to prune candidate APIs. When there are too many APIs, the retriever identifies the top-k most relevant\n\n487 APIs to present to the LLMs.\n\n488 Shortlisting the relevant API from user instructions typically requires a large-scale dataset of\n\n489 instruction-API pairs (Chen et al, 2021). Instead of collecting such data through human annotation,\n\n490 which is expensive and time-consuming, we automatically synthesize language instructions given infor\n491 mation about an API (Wang et al, 2022). Specifically, we provide LLMs with the API name, description,\n\n492 and argument list as input and prompt them to generate five varied, detailed, and verbose instructions\n\n493 for making API calls. To improve robustness and generalization across di!erent usage scenarios, we also\n\n494 generate five precise and concise instructions. In total, we synthesize ten language instructions for each\n\n495 API. Detailed prompts for instruction generation, including examples, can be found in Sec. A.5.4.\n\n496 With instruction-API pairs available, we train an API retriever that encodes both the instruction and\n\n497 API documentation as embeddings. The relevance between an instruction and API is then determined\n\n498 by the cosine similarity between these embeddings. The retriever is fine-tuned from a Sentence-BERT\n\n499 model (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) to maximize the similarity of matching API-instruction pairs and\n\n500 minimize the similarity of randomly sampled negative API-instruction pairs. Consequently, for a new\n\n501 user instruction, the trained API retriever generates a ranked list of APIs based on embedding-based\n\n502 cosine similarity, where higher-ranked APIs are considered more relevant to the user\u2019s instruction (Refer\n\n503 to Fig. A.4 for more details).\n\n504 **4.1.5 API prediction**\n\n505 With the shortlisted APIs from the API retriever, the API predictor further refines the list to identify the\n\n506 best match. For this purpose, we frame API prediction as an in-context API selection task. Specifically, we\n\n507 supply the API shortlist alongside several demonstrations, where each demonstration includes a synthetic\n\n508 instruction paired with its corresponding API information. These randomly selected demonstrations assist\n\n509 LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in grasping the underlying relationships between instructions and APIs, thereby\n\n510 enabling more accurate API predictions. It is worth noting that in the tool parsing stage (Sec. 4.1.1),\n\n511 we faced challenges related to API design, such as di!erent APIs having similar descriptions or identical\n\n512 names, which introduced ambiguity and could negatively a!ect API prediction accuracy (Refer to Sec.\n\n513 2.1 for more details). In cases where ambiguous APIs with similar descriptions or identical names are\n\n514 identified, we generate an ambiguity list for each API and prompt users for clarification to determine the\n\n515 correct target API. Detailed prompts for API prediction, including examples, can be found in Sec. A.5.5.\n\n516 **4.1.6 Argument prediction**\n\n517 To generate an executable API call, we further predict both the required and optional argument values\n\n518 based on the predicted API call. For each argument, we supply the LLMs with the user instruction, the\n\n519 predicted API (including its name and description), and details of the argument under consideration\n\n520 (such as its name, description, data type, and default value), along with a list of possible values. A\n\n521 key prerequisite for accurately predicting argument values is ensuring that the LLMs strictly follow\n\n522 the required argument format, avoiding the generation of confidently incorrect or incompatible values\n\n523 for the API call. To accomplish this, we categorize argument types into three groups: (1) The Literal\n\n524 type, where the choice is restricted to a small set of predefined values; (2) The Bool type, where the\n\n525 choice is \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d, depending on whether the argument is present; and (3) Other types, which\n\n526 include \u201cstring\u201d, \u201cint\u201d, \u201cfloat\u201d, and similar basic data types. LLMs are instructed to handle each group\n\n527 separately, selecting the argument\u2019s value from the user instruction or returning the default value if no\n\n528 prediction is made (Refer to Fig. A.6 for more details).\n\n529 It\u2019s important to highlight the challenges of argument prediction in BioMANIA, as not all arguments\n\n530 can be inferred directly from the user\u2019s instruction. For example, predicting a Pandas dataframe or\n\n531 Numpy multidimensional array based solely on user input is nearly impossible. We reasoned that such\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\n532 information should be derived from earlier API call events in the conversation. Therefore, for these more\n\n533 complex arguments, rather than predicting them, we extract variables from the stack traces of previously\n\n534 executed API calls that match the required argument type. Detailed prompts for argument prediction,\n\n535 including examples, can be found in Sec. A.5.6.\n\n536 **4.1.7 API execution**\n\n537 With the API and arguments predicted, BioMANIA uses a Python interpreter to execute the API call.\n\n538 However, calling errors are to be expected due to various reasons, such as incorrect formatting of input\n\n539 arguments or missing dependencies. Therefore, it is crucial to have robust troubleshooting mechanisms\n\n540 in place to continuously resolve these errors until successful code execution is achieved. BioMANIA is\n\n541 designed to refine API calling code by collecting all relevant error information when a call fails and\n\n542 prompting LLMs to troubleshoot and iteratively revise the code. The collected error information includes\n\n543 the error message, relevant Git issues, a description of the task and API, execution history, and other\n\n544 related details. Drawing on their built-in knowledge and the provided error information, the LLMs can\n\n545 intelligently diagnose the cause of the error and revise the code accordingly. Detailed prompts for code\n\n546 troubleshooting, including examples, can be found in Sec. A.5.8.\n\n547 After the API\u2019s success execution, BioMANIA construct comprehensive natural language-based\n\n548 responses from three perspectives. First, BioMANIA integrates all information from previous stages into\n\n549 a concise summary, encompassing API prediction and execution from API execution. Refer to Sec. A.5.3\n\n550 for detailed prompts for task summarization). Second, BioMANIA presents the execution results in a\n\n551 user-friendly format, like a plotting figure or a snapshot of the data matrix. Third, BioMANIA orga\n552 nizes the API calls into a downloadable script for reproducibility and generates a comprehensive report\n\n553 recording the entire data analysis process. In addition, BioMANIA o!ers step-by-step explanations of\n\n554 the generated code for educational purposes. Detailed prompts for code explanation, including examples,\n\n555 can be found in Sec. A.5.7.\n\n556 **4.2 Tools used for evaluation**\n\n557 To evaluate the e!ectiveness of BioMANIA, we applied BioMANIA to a range of commonly used\n\n558 bioinformatics tools, covering diverse application domains (Refer to Fig. A.1 for more details):\n\n559 [\u2022 Scanpy (Wolf et al, 2018).

However, whether this assumption holds true in real-world scenarios remains\n\n588 uncertain. To assess the extent to which this assumption is violated, we assembled a diverse group of\n\n589 human annotators to manually label three di!erent instructions for each API across various tools, cre\n590 ating an independent test set. To provide a comparative perspective, we used GPT-4 to generate five\n\n591 detailed and five concise synthetic instructions with varying tones for each API. For each API, eight\n\n592 out of the ten synthetic instructions were assigned to the training split to train the API retriever and\n\n593 predictor, while the remaining two were reserved for evaluation.\n\n594 **4.4 Code and data availability**\n\n595 [The software implementation in this study are available at https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA.](https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA)\n\n596 [The Docker images for the tools used by BioMANIA are available at https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/chatbotuibiomania)\n\n597 [repositories/chatbotuibiomania.

Cell biology experiments are defined by the applied treatment, cellular state,\nand the assayed phenotype. Given the vast number of possible combinations, testing every\nscenario is impractical. We present Prophet, a transformer-based computational model for\ncellular phenotype prediction. Prophet learns a representation of the cell biology experiment\nspace, enabling it to predict the outcomes of untested small molecule or genetic perturbations in\nnew cellular contexts across diverse phenotypes including gene expression, cell viability, and\ncell morphology. Its scalable architecture facilitates training across independent assays, using\ntransfer learning to enhance performance across phenotypes. In vitro validation shows\nProphet's potential to guide experimental design, making it a valuable tool for accelerating\nbiological discovery.\n\n### Introduction\n\nHigh-throughput screening and multiplexed phenotypic readouts have revolutionized biological\nexperimentation. They enable simultaneous testing of thousands of compounds across\nnumerous biological contexts, accelerating the pace of discovery. For instance, small molecule\nand CRISPR screens have been conducted to systematically interrogate the biological\n[mechanisms of cancer resistance (1, 2), identify new drug targets (3, 4), capture synergistic](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/lAyf+k06Y)\n[interactions (5), and deconvolve drug mechanisms of action (6\u20139). While statistical and](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/wSm1)\nAI-based analyses have facilitated discoveries in each screen, a key limitation of past models is\n[the lack of integration across screens (10, 11), despite considerable overlap in experiments\u2014for](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/kBPU+cIB3)\ninstance, the same cell line treated with different compounds or genetic perturbations, or the\nsame experiment measured with different readouts. Learning across all of these screens could\n\n\n-----\n\nprovide notable increases in the efficiency of identifying effective and cell-context specific\n[compounds while simultaneously making findings more robust across technical variation (12).](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/hVyp)\n\nGiven the immense combinatorial space inherent to biological experimentation, accurate in\n_silico modeling is needed to guide the selection of relevant future experiments and reduce the_\n[number of early-stage experiments needed to yield new biological insights(13). While previous](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/fo3H)\n[methods offer tailored solutions for specific experimental contexts (11, 14\u201318), we propose a](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/J2Z5+1tmT+Hi9c+wkjS+ZG9b+cIB3)\ngeneral approach to treatment response prediction which can fully leverage the vast data\nresources now available. Inspired by the success of transformers in solving complex problems\nacross various domains by modeling data as a set of tokens to be transformed towards an\n[outcome (19\u201321), we develop a novel approach to cellular response prediction: modeling the](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/iRhs+UzLL+sx6X)\nexperimental space using set-based representations. We universally decompose each\n\nexperiment into a unique combination of three fundamental elements\u2014the cellular state, the\ntreatments being performed, and the intended phenotypic readout. This approach forms the\nbasis for our model, Prophet (Predictor of phenotypes), a transformer-based regression model\nthat learns the relationships between these factors. Prophet\u2019s framework enables it to be\npretrained on 4.7 million experiments across a broad spectrum of phenotypes from multiple\nindependent datasets, producing accurate predictions that empower downstream applications,\nsuch as nominating additional chemotherapeutic drugs for BRAF-mutant melanoma and\nreducing the number of experiments needed for viability screens by at least 60x. Together, its\nscaling behavior and strong predictive capacity establish Prophet as a robust general model for\ntreatment response in biological systems.\n\n### Results\n\n#### A unified framework for experimental cell biology\n\nWe consider the outcome of a cell biology experiment as the composite of three essential\ncomponents: the cell state the experiment is performed in, the applied treatment, and the\nphenotypic readout used to measure the effect of the perturbation (Fig. 1a, b). The cellular state\nrepresents the basal state before treatment. For instance, most drug screens are performed on\ncell lines that we characterize as the cell state. The treatment is the specific intervention or\nperturbation applied to the cells during the experiment. Commonly, these are genetic\nperturbations (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts, CRISPRi/a) or drug perturbations with small\nmolecules. Finally, the phenotypic readout is the measurable outcome used to assess the effect\nof the applied treatment on the cell state; for example a morphological measurement such as\ncell size, or the IC50 of a compound. To model the relationship between these elements in a\ngeneralizable way, we developed Prophet, a supervised transformer-based deep learning model\n(Fig. 1b, c). To train it, we collected 9 perturbational datasets to create the largest compendium\n[of publicly available screening datasets to date: SCORE(3, 22), LINCS(23), JUMP(8), GDSC(3,](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/PC4J+qx2d)\n_[22, 24), GDSC[2(][)], CTRP(26), PRISM(1), Horlbeck et al.(27) and Saunders et al.(28) (fig. S1,](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/PC4J+qx2d+MKae)_\nTable S1). For example, we consider one measurement of the IC50 of the drug isoniazid in HeLa\ncells a single experiment that is passed to Prophet as one datapoint. Measuring cell morphology\nafter the same treatment in the same cell line would be a different data point, and so would\n\n\n-----\n\nmeasuring the IC50 of the same drug in another cell line (Fig. 1c). We hypothesized that when\ntrained across a sufficient amount of experimental data, a single model could be employed to\nmake predictions for any compound or genetic treatment, and for any cell line or cell type (Fig.\n1).\n\n[Prophet\u2019s architecture consists of 8 transformer encoder units (29, 30) with 8 attention heads](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/5EnFv+2NQOW)\nper layer and a feed-forward network with a hidden dimensionality of 1,024 to generate a\n512-dimensional embedding of each experiment (Fig. 1c, fig. S2). Prophet leverages existing\nknowledge of cellular states and treatments by projecting prior knowledge-based\n\nrepresentations into a common token space using neural networks as tokenizers. The readout\nrepresentations are modeled as learnable embeddings, directly projected in the token space.\nThrough self-attention, Prophet effectively captures relationships between treatments, cellular\nstates, and phenotypic outcomes, facilitating nuanced learning and prediction. The output of the\ntransformer is fed into a feed-forward network that predicts the phenotype of interest. Prophet is\ntrained end-to-end using supervised learning to minimize mean square error (MSE) between the\npredicted and measured phenotypes.\n\nTo make prior knowledge available for training Prophet, we create representation vectors for\neach axis of the experimental space, encoding the cellular environment the experiment is\nconducted in, and the treatments that are applied, to serve as input to the model.\nTo represent cell state, as most small molecule and CRISPR screens are performed in cell lines,\n[we use bulk RNA sequencing data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (31), which](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/QaFU)\ncovers 1,406 cell lines. For in vivo treatments, we assume each cell type in a tissue represents\none cell state and encode them using their RNA expression profile after pseudobulk\naggregation.\nFor treatments, we use two different methods of generating embeddings depending on whether\nthe treatment is a small molecule or genetic perturbation. For small molecules, we create\n[descriptive embeddings by concatenating their RDKit2D and Morgan fingerprints (32, 33). For](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/LUH0+8CWo)\ngenetic perturbations, we build a vector that represents the target gene as the concatenation of\na vector capturing its transcriptomic variability and a vector that represents its genomic\nsequence (Methods). We obtain the transcriptomic variability vector by transposing the CCLE\n\u201ccell line x gene expression\u201d matrix and finding a low dimensional representation of the genes\n[using PCA. We derive the genomic sequence vector from Enformer\u2019s embeddings (34) for the](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/BWIo)\nentire coding sequence of the gene.\nSince there is no prior knowledge suitable to represent an embedding of most phenotypes, we\nmodel them as a learnable embedding through one hot encodings and a linear layer. However, if\nthere exists a suitable prior knowledge-based representation of the phenotype, it can be used\nas input to a tokenizer network, similar to treatment and cell state representations.\n\nProphet is capable of jointly modeling diverse cellular phenotypes used as readouts in\nexperiments. We train Prophet to predict cell viability, compound IC50, Cell Painting morphology\n[features (35), mRNA transcript abundance, and cell type proportion. Its transformer-based](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/kuT9)\narchitecture allows Prophet to handle an arbitrary number of perturbations, from singletons to\nany combination, so that datasets with single treatments and combinations can be modeled\n\n\n-----\n\nunder the same learning framework. Additionally, utilizing prior knowledge-based embeddings\nenables Prophet to predict in silico outcomes for experiments performed in unseen conditions,\nextrapolating to unseen perturbations or cellular states.\n\n**Fig. 1. Prophet is a universal phenotype predictor. (A) Prophet models the experimental space along**\n\n\n**Fig. 1. Prophet is a universal phenotype predictor. (A) Prophet models the experimental space along**\n\n\n-----\n\nthree axes, namely cellular state, treatments, and phenotypic readout. Each point in the experimental\nspace is mapped to its corresponding phenotypic readout. We illustrate an example of how Prophet\nsamples two different points of the experimental space. The two points differ in the biological system\nthese experiments were performed in: HaCaT and A375 cells. This flexibility enables Prophet to be\ntrained across datasets. (B) Cellular states and treatments are passed to Prophet as prior\n\nknowledge-based representations. Phenotypes can be either modeled as a learnable embedding or\ngrounded on prior knowledge. (C) Prophet relies on a transformer-based architecture that leverages\nself-attention and permutation equivariance to represent the experimental context as a set and obtain a\nmeaningful representation that maps to the phenotypic readout. It consists of tokenizer networks that take\nprior knowledge to create tokens, the transformer to which those tokens are fed and a small regression\nhead that uses the output of the transformer to get a readout prediction. Prophet can predict any\nquantitative phenotype, including cell viability, gene expression and cell morphology.\n\n#### Transfer learning improves in silico experimental prediction\n\nWe assessed Prophet's efficacy in predicting the outcome of unseen experiments. We\nconducted five-fold cross-validation with three validation seeds (Methods, fig. S5a) and\ncompared the average coefficient of determination (R2) and the Spearman correlation of\nProphet against three baseline architectures: random forest, a multilayer perceptron, and linear\nregression. For each method we report the difference in R2 and Spearman correlation to the\nmean estimator (Methods). The mean estimator serves as a global approximation of a treatment\nor cell state response based on prior experiments (fig. S5a, Methods) and is considered a\n[robust baseline in drug response prediction (11).](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/cIB3)\n\nWe first trained specialized models on each dataset individually, with the same architecture but\na smaller number of parameters to prevent overfitting (Fig. 2a, Methods). We call these models\n\u201cProphet-individual\u201d (for hyperparameter tuning, see Supplementary Methods, Table S2). These\nProphet-individual models generally outperform baseline methods across the board (Fig. 2b).\nThen, to benchmark Prophet\u2019s transfer learning capabilities, we conducted experiments training\n[jointly on two datasets (Prophet-two-dataset). We combined training on GDSC[2(][)], a small](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/VQiM)\n[molecule combinatorial perturbation screen reporting IC50 values, with PRISM(1), a much larger](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/lAyf)\nsingle-treatment screen relying on a CellTiterGlo viability readout. PRISM contains 8 of the 61\ncompounds and 76 of the 110 cell lines in GDSC. Performance for both unseen treatments and\nunseen cell lines in GDSC improved by 3% and 28%, respectively, after joint training with\nPRISM. These results suggested Prophet could benefit from joint training on additional datasets\nand prompted us to increase the amount of datasets used during pretraining.\n\nWe then pretrained our largest Prophet model on 4.7 million experimental conditions,\nencompassing 26k treatments, 1,550 cell states, and three different readouts (IC50, viability and\nRNA expression) across seven small molecule and genetic perturbation screens (fig. S2a, b,\nTable S1). Afterwards, we fine-tuned the model for up to 20,000 steps with a batch size of up to\n256 observations and a low learning rate (Fig. 2a, Methods, Table S3). This approach follows\n[the same strategy as current foundation models (19, 36, 37), which are pre-trained on large](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/iRhs+LLyG+lItb)\namounts of data and then fine-tuned for specific datasets using the pre-trained model as a\nbackbone.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 2. Prophet\u2019s performance and scaling across diverse datasets. (A) Prophet-individual models**\n(top) are Prophet models trained only on a single dataset. On the other hand, the full Prophet model\n(bottom) is pretrained using all datasets and then fine tuned on the dataset of interest. (B) Improvement in\nthe R2 score over the mean baseline of the models evaluated: linear regression, multilayer perceptron\n(MLP), Random Forest, single-assay Prophet (Prophet-individual) and fine-tuned Prophet (Prophet). (C)\nProphet accurately predicts the IC50 value of the unseen compound mitoxantrone, a clinically approved\n\n\n-----\n\ncompound, against different cancers. (D) The fluorescent RNA readout of the gene TNFRSF21 is not part\nof the pre-training corpus. However, fine-tuning Prophet on it still yields better results than the mean\nestimator and than training a Prophet-individual model only on this dataset. (E) In GDSC, fine-tuned\nProphet outperforms Prophet-individual, the mean estimator and also a Prophet-two-dataset model\ntrained jointly in GDSC and PRISM. Notably, Prophet is fine-tuned for just 20,000 steps with a batch size\nof 256 observations \u2013 much fewer optimization steps than the other models, which highlights the\neffectiveness of the pre-training stage. (F) The area-under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is 0.81 for\n_hit identification in GDSC - defining each hit as a compound that causes at least a 2x fold change in cell_\nviability. (G) The variance in the R2 score obtained by Prophet is reduced as more parts of the\nexperimental space - more cell states and more treatments - are sampled during training.\n\nWe find that pretraining Prophet on all datasets and fine tuning for the dataset of interest\nconsistently matches or outperforms baseline models, including Prophet-individual models,\nacross all datasets, with baseline models frequently failing to outperform the mean estimator\n(Fig. 2b). Prophet demonstrates notable performance not only in predicting responses to small\nmolecule monotherapies (GDSC, CTRP, PRISM) but also in predicting the outcomes of unseen\ngenetic perturbations (SCORE). In addition, Prophet successfully predicts the effect of the\ncombination of two drugs and the combination of two CRISPR perturbations (GDSC\n\ncombinations and Horlbeck, respectively). To showcase Prophet\u2019s ability to extrapolate to\nunseen scenarios we predict the IC50 of Mitoxantrone, a clinically approved compound indicated\n[for multiple cancers (38, 39), which does not appear in any dataset in training. Still, Prophet\u2019s de](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/EOzF+RgPh)\nnovo predicted IC50 for Mitoxantrone reflects its efficacy in different cancer types (Fig. 2c), and is\n[corroborated by the IC50 values measured in GDSC (24) as well as other publications (40, 41).](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/MKae)\nFurthermore, in addition to viability, Prophet accurately predicts diverse and complex\n\nmeasurements including cell morphology (JUMP) and transcriptomics (LINCS) (Fig. 2b). This\ngeneralizability serves as evidence of Prophet\u2019s ability to enable transfer learning, leveraging\ninformation across multiple screens. As an example, pretraining Prophet and fine-tuning it on\nGDSC outperforms Prophet-individual by 70% in predicting unseen treatments and by 30% in\npredicting experiments on unseen cell states. Most notably, it also outperforms a Prophet model\ntrained on PRISM and GDSC (Prophet-two-datasets) by 28% in predicting unseen treatments\nand by 29% in predicting experiments on unseen cell states (Fig. 2e).\n\nProphet\u2019s transfer learning capability is not limited to phenotypes seen during the pre-training\nstage. We did not pre-train Prophet on any morphological measurement, but Prophet fine-tuned\non JUMP outperformed both the Prophet-individual model trained only on JUMP and the\nbaseline (Fig. 2b). We observed the same behavior with unseen RNA readouts: the mRNA\nabundance readout of the gene TNFRSF21 from LINCS was not included in the pre-training\ncorpus; nonetheless, the fine-tuned version of Prophet is 25% better than the baseline and 10%\nbetter than a single-dataset Prophet model trained uniquely on TNFRSF21 readouts (Fig. 2d).\n\nThe prediction of the most likely treatments to be a hit, defined as an intervention that results in\na desired biological effect, can reduce the number of total screening experiments needed.\nCritically, Prophet\u2019s performance is not limited to accurate prediction of values close to the mean\nbut Prophet also accurately predicts extreme values\u2014hence, possible hits (fig. S5b). Therefore,\n\n\n-----\n\nwe can use Prophet to generate in silico outcomes for treatment or cell state combinations not\nyet tested, and use these values to suggest experiments which are most likely to produce a\ndesired phenotype. As a case example, we take Prophet\u2019s in silico simulated viability values and\ncompute the increase in the number of hits over randomly selecting compounds from the GDSC\nlibrary. We define a hit as a compound that induces greater than 2x fold-change in viability as\ncompared to DMSO in a given cell line (Supplementary Methods). Using Prophet to predict\n\nviability for drugs in unseen cell lines in GDSC shows an improvement in R2 of .04 over the\nmean estimator (Fig. 2b). However, this increase translates into a 13x increase in the number of\nhits when performing experiments suggested by Prophet. Here, Prophet achieves an\n\narea-under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of .81 (Fig. 2f). When identifying hits with a more\nstringent viability fold-change of at least 4x, the potential of Prophet is even more apparent:\nhere, Prophet leads to a reduction in performed experiments of 60x compared to identifying hits\nfrom randomly selected compounds (Supplementary Methods). Prophet was conservative in its\npredictions and had no false positives among its top-ranked 1% of hits. In addition to\nprecision-recall, we further evaluate using Spearman rank (fig. S5c). Prophet outperforms the\nbaseline models and the mean in all instances in which it also did the same using R2. This\ndemonstrates that Prophet not only accurately predicts phenotypic values but also effectively\ncaptures the underlying ranking of responses, indicating its ability to make reliable comparisons\nacross different experimental conditions.\n\nTo investigate how the uncertainty of Prophet varies with the number of conditions (cell states\nand treatments) seen during training, we trained an ensemble of Prophet models. We found a\nclear trend: the more treatments and cell states seen by Prophet, the higher the confidence in\nthe predictions (Fig. 2g). Likewise, we also studied how the performance of Prophet changes as\na function of the number of conditions seen during training: we trained Prophet-individual\nmodels to predict the effect of either unseen treatments or unseen cell states, including 5-80%\nof the data along the respective axis. The amount of data required to outperform the mean\nestimation varies per dataset, but as expected we observe that Prophet\u2019s predictions improve\nwith additional training data (fig. S4, S5).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 3. Prophet learns a map of the experimental space. (A) Schematic of how Prophet generates a**\ncomplete experimental space in silico.

For the treatment space, Prophet predicts the IC50 for each\ncompound or compound combination across 979 cell lines. Each single or combinatorial treatment is then\n\n\n-----\n\nrepresented as a 979-dimensional vector, in which each dimension is Prophet\u2019s IC50 prediction for that\ncompound in one cell line. We call this treatment representation an \u201cactivity-based fingerprint\u201d.

(F) IC50 treatment\nspace for a subset of brain and central nervous system cancer cell lines, where calcium channel blockers\n(zoom in) are clustered together and exhibit a differential effect. (G) To model cell line space with Prophet,\neach cell line is represented as a vector in which each dimension is Prophet\u2019s IC50 prediction for one\ncompound in that cell line. (H) Here we model the activity of EGFR inhibitor treatments in non-small cell\nlung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Each point is a cell line represented as a vector in which each dimension\nis the predicted IC50 value for each treatment in that cell line for a set of NSCLC cell lines and EGFR\ninhibitors. The cell lines HC4006, NCIH1975, NCIH1650, HCC827 and CALU3 are known to be sensitive\nto EGFR inhibitors. Points are colored by predicted IC50 sensitivity (Methods) to EGFR inhibitors. Lower\nIC50 values imply higher sensitivity and higher cell death.\n\nProphet encounters challenges in outperforming the mean estimator in certain scenarios, such\nas predicting the effects of observed treatments in unobserved cell lines within SCORE, or\nforecasting the impacts of untested small molecules in known cell lines within LINCS. Further\ninvestigation revealed that the correlation between experimental replicates is a crucial metric for\nevaluating the predictability of their outcomes. We conducted a statistical analysis of the\ncorrelation between replicates (Table S4). This analysis revealed that, along the problematic\naxis, replicates of the same experimental conditions are less similar to one another than to the\nreplicates of any other random condition. In such cases of noisy data with a strong batch effect\nthe mean estimator is the best possible predictor.\n\n#### Prophet learns a universal landscape of biological experiments\n\nDrug screens are limited in scope, either by the number of compounds tested or the variety of\ncell states. Hence, they provide a limited view of the profile of a compound, encompassing just\nthe effects in the tested cell states. Including more cell states would provide a more robust and\n[informative view of the pharmacological profile of a drug (1). Now, with Prophet, we can](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/lAyf)\nexamine the treatment effect in silico across hundreds of cell lines at once. We represent each\nsmall molecule\u2014or combinations of small molecules\u2014as a vector in which each dimension is\nthe Prophet-predicted viability value in each cancer cell line (Fig. 3a). This vector represents an\n\u201cactivity-based fingerprint\u201d for each compound. In this high-dimensional representation,\n\ncompounds with similar sensitivity profiles across cancer cell lines cluster together when viewed\nusing a 2D representation (Fig. 3b). We can draw comparisons between these shared response\n\n\n-----\n\npatterns for unbiased annotations of mechanisms of action (Fig. 3c), identification of new\ntherapeutic candidates (Fig. 3d, e), or isolation of tissue-specific mechanisms (Fig. 3f, fig. S7a).\n\n**Compounds which target pathways of cell proliferation. We used Prophet to generate viability**\npredictions for 8,620 small molecule treatments in 979 cell lines (Fig. 3a). We concatenated the\n979 cell line values per drug to construct an activity-based fingerprint, which together form a\nviability-contextualized small molecule manifold (Fig. 3b). We focus on four distinct clusters in\nthis space (Fig. 3c, fig. S6a) containing a total of 64 compounds that target specific regulators of\ncell proliferation: two from the MAPK signaling cascade (containing compounds targeting MEK\nand EGFR), and two from the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Two of the 64 compounds have never\nbeen seen in the training data (fig. S6b). With each of the 8,620 compounds tested in an\naverage of 365 out of 979 cell lines, Prophet accurately completed 75.2% of the cell line \u2715 drug\nexperimental space, grouping compounds in an unbiased manner after limited or no training\nexamples.\n\nProphet\u2019s identified clusters are also biologically precise: after annotating the 64 compounds\n(Table S7, Supplementary Methods, fig. S6a), we found only one potential misclassification: the\nHSP90 inhibitor tanespimycin, which Prophet identifies as similar in effect to mTOR\n\n[inhibitors(42). Additionally, we noted one misannotation: Ibrutinib, typically labeled as a BTK](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/FeoL)\ninhibitor, has been shown to bind to the EGFR mutant kinase in non-small cell lung cancer\n[(NSCLC) (43, 44). We suggest that Ibrutinib also has a similar effect in other cancer types. The](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/etMp+VyLw)\njoint clustering could be a pure effect of chemical similarity\u2014however, we find compounds show\nconsiderable dissimilarity in chemical space (fig. S6c, Supplementary Methods). This indicates\nthat the experiment representations learned by Prophet are driven by the phenotypic effects of\nsmall molecule treatments rather than their chemical structures, underscoring the utility of this\nmanifold in capturing biologically relevant information which could not be identified using\nstructural similarity alone.\n\n**Therapeutic treatment candidates in BRAF-V600E mutant melanoma. We wondered whether we**\ncan identify compounds which phenocopy existing, clinically approved treatments. To this end,\nwe examined Prophet\u2019s predictions for four compounds already clinically approved for BRAF\nV600E-mutant melanoma. From the full 979 cell line viability space above, we create a\nsubspace of 23 melanoma cell lines categorized as either BRAF V600E-mutant or -wild-type\n(Fig. 3e). 74% of these experiments were unseen in training. Such cancers respond well to\n[various MEK and BRAF inhibitors (45\u201347). This subspace reveals a cluster of compounds](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/4Dou+rma4+6pqc)\n[containing three clinically approved monotherapies (46, 48, 49) and two combination therapies](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/rma4+9j6E+GdD9)\n[(47, 50) which are highlighted in bold (Fig. 3e). 45% of the other compounds in this cluster have](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/6pqc+KwCk)\nbeen indicated for BRAF V600E melanoma in in vitro experiments (Table S8), suggesting that\nthe remaining compounds are relevant therapeutic candidates.\nWe further examine the predicted viability per cell line. Two out of 6 wild-type cell lines were on\naverage sensitive to compounds in this cluster, compared to 9 out of 17 BRAF V600E-mutants\n(Fig. S8a). Among these, resistance to MEK or RAF inhibition despite the BRAF V600E\nmutation has been documented in certain cell lines, such as A2058's resistance to MEK inhibitor\n\n\n-----\n\n[PD0325901 (51), a behavior our model accurately predicts (fig. S8b) even though the current](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/7kM2)\nmechanism of resistance remains unclear.\n\n**Predicting brain and CNS-specific monotherapies. A similar in silico generated subspace of**\nperturbation effects in brain and central nervous system (CNS)-derived cell lines reveals a\ncluster of neurological compounds, enriched for putative calcium channel blockers\n\n(p-value<10[-7], Fig. 3f, Supplementary Methods) which did not cluster when looking at global\ntissue responses (fig. S7c). Calcium signaling promotes growth and tumorigenesis of brain\n[cancers (52). Recent studies demonstrate that calcium channel inhibition suppresses brain](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/vwfq)\ntumor growth, decreases the expression of oncogenes and increases expression of tumor\n[suppressor genes, even proposing to repurpose existing drugs to treat brain cancers (53, 54).](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/CXas)\n\n**Experimental space contextualized by RNA expression. While the compound space detailed**\nabove was constructed using Prophet-predicted viability values, Prophet can also construct a\ncompound space using other readouts, such as RNA expression learned from the LINCS\ndataset. We make predictions for BIRC5 expression after treatment in the same set of\ncompounds and cell lines (fig. S7d), expanding the original by 5,846 small molecules and 922\ncell lines. This new space captures patterns of BIRC5 expression after compound treatment (fig.\nS7e). This enables us to identify a set of MEK inhibitors affecting BIRC5 expression and reveals\na new cluster of compounds acting on BIRC5 (fig. S7f). Although BIRC5 expression after\nperturbation has not been reported in the literature for many of these compounds, the cluster\nincludes a survivin inhibitor and Auranofin, which has been reported to downregulate BIRC5 in\n[osteosarcoma(55). Both of these compounds were not previously tested in LINCS.](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/P5xH)\n\n**Identifying EGFR sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer. Applying drug activity fingerprint**\nconcept to cell lines, we can also generate a fingerprint for cell lines which we can use to\ninvestigate the response signatures of biological systems to a specific array of drugs. As an\nexample, we identify non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines that react to EGFR inhibition.\nWe subset the experimental space to NSCLC cell lines and compute an average EGFR\ninhibition sensitivity score per cell line (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Methods). EGFR mutant cell\nlines, with a constitutively active EGFR receptor, are often especially sensitive to EGFR\n[inhibitors (56). Prophet identifies a gradient in the cell lines with respect to sensitivity to EGFR](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/Guwj)\ninhibitors, and is successful at scoring five known putative EGFR mutant or EGFR-sensitive cell\n[lines as EGFR sensitive (H1975, H1650, HCC4006, HCC827 and CALU3) (57\u201359) (Fig. 3h).](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/zmjD+xFJT+1mwe)\n\n#### In vitro experimental design and validation\n\nTo further demonstrate the accuracy of Prophet\u2019s predictions, we experimentally validated a\nsubset of the model\u2019s predictions. To do so, we used a setup with existing pre-built 384-well\nplates, each with 352 unique drug perturbations applied to 9 cancer cell lines (Table S9). In\ntotal, there were 16 pre-built plates. This setup represents a scenario in which limitations in\nexperiment size constrain the compounds and cell lines that can be tested.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 4.

(D) Absolute CellTitreGlo fluorescence values from the in\nvitro experiments (three replicates) vs. Prophet\u2019s predicted values (6 ensembles). Boxes show the\nquartiles, and whiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box. Prophet provides tight\nuncertainty bounds for these predictions, and more loose uncertainty for the U2OS cell line.\n\nAiming to pick a plate with maximally diverse drug responses across cell lines, we used Prophet\nto make in silico predictions for the outcomes of the compounds in each plate in the nine\navailable cell lines. We used the predicted effects on cell viability to score each plate in two\ncategories\u2014dissimilarity across compounds and similarity within clusters (fig. S9a,\n\nSupplementary Methods). We then tested the selected plate and compared the results to\nProphet\u2019s predictions. Prophet successfully predicted the overall outcome for the entire plate,\nwith a median of 0.53 Spearman correlation (Fig. 4c), despite not having seen any related data\nduring training. Comparing the predicted viability scores for each compound of the selected\nplate with viability measurements in PRISM, the dataset with the best coverage of the\ncompounds and cell lines out of which 8/9 cell lines and 41/352 compounds were also tested,\nresulted in a median of 0.07 Spearman correlation (Fig. 4c).\n\nFor the two known MEK inhibitors tested, GDC-0623 and AZD8330, Prophet correctly predicted\nno significant change in cell viability after treatment specifically in MCF7, but none of the other\ncell lines, with high certainty (Fig. 4d, fig. S9b). Our experimental validation confirmed this\nobservation (Fig. 4d), showing that both MEK inhibitors produced no significant changes in\nviability in MCF7 cells, but significant changes in other cell lines. This finding is supported by\n\n\n-----\n\n[previous work documenting MCF7 resistance to some MEK inhibitors, including trametinib(60),](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/3dSl)\n[but not other MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib and pimasertib(61). Prophet independently](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/uecn)\nuncovers this highly specific resistance despite not previously seeing either compound in MCF7\ncells in training, and not seeing GDC-0623 at all.\n\n#### Prophet predicts in vivo phenotypes\n\n[Prophet's capabilities extend to in vivo experimental settings. Saunders et al. 2023 (28)](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/Tnlf)\ngenerated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the effect of 23 genetic knockouts\u2014including\ncombinations\u2014on 1,812 developing zebrafish embryos across 5 timepoints (Fig. 5a). Their\nanalysis includes using the single-cell transcriptomics data to compute relative cell type\nfrequencies for each embryo (Fig. 5b) and comparing the genetic perturbations using similarities\nand differences in cell type proportion change. In this high-dimensional space, genetic\nperturbations clustered together based on the affected zebrafish developmental lineage. Given\nour framework, we asked if Prophet could learn these cell type proportion changes and make\npredictions about additional knockouts for specific lineages.\n\nGiven that this is the only in vivo dataset and that no common prior knowledge exists for it within\nour dataset compendium, we did not use any pretrained Prophet version, but trained a single\nProphet model from scratch (Methods). We then used the predicted relative cell type\nfrequencies to construct a zebrafish cell type proportion experimental space, extending it with\npredictions of single knockouts, and analyzed perturbation-dependent deviations relative to\nwild-type embryos (Fig. 5c).\n\nDespite only 23 perturbations in the dataset, the cell type proportion experimental space learnt\nby Prophet qualitatively matches the one obtained by the authors in Fig. 2c of the original\npublication (Fig. 5d, top panel), where it can be seen that different gene knockouts provoke\ndifferent responses in terms of cell type proportion in the zebrafish embryos. The gene knockout\nfingerprints learnt by Prophet group genes according to their involvement in the mesoderm,\nnervous system and neural crest lineages (Fig. 5d, bottom panel). We also run predictions for\nsingleton knock outs of zebrafish transcription factors (TFs): for example, znf711 and znf740b\nfrom the zf-C2H2 family and dbpb, bach1b from the bZIP family, to produce additional\ncandidates for further experiments.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig. 5.

(F) The predicted absolute cell\ntype proportion of anterior migratory muscle at 5 timepoints for the top 1 and 3 predicted gene targets,\nwith control as comparison.\n\nAs an example, we run Prophet to get predictions of gene targets that reduce the cell type\nproportion of anterior migratory muscle at 36 hours post-fertilization (hpf)(Supplementary\nMethods). We measure the strength of a knockout as fold change using the control embryo cell\ntype proportion at 36hpf as a reference. Among the top 10 gene targets predicted (Fig. 5e), we\nfind that Rsp02 and Hopx rank first and third, respectively; for both genes, previous studies\n[describe their key role in mesoderm development (62); (63, 64). Other genes in the top-5 (Bmp1](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/PZUl)\n[and Wnt8b) are part of families of genes also involved in mesoderm development(65\u201367). All](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/NEpr+j0Ak+Bnya)\nten of the Prophet-predicted strongest gene knockouts are not part of the original dataset.\nProphet\u2019s predictions also report an uncertainty obtained from the variance of predictions of an\nensemble of models (Methods). This informs experimentalists of Prophet\u2019s confidence in a\nprediction, allowing them to make an informed decision about whether or not to include high\nuncertainty TFs in a panel.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, Prophet can also provide fine-grained predictions across timepoints by incorporating the\ntime of the readout into the readout token. The proportion of anterior migratory muscle cells\nvaries across time points given an F0 knockout in a zebrafish embryo in the genes Rspo2 and\nHopx (Fig. 5f). These detailed temporal predictions can assist biologists to make more informed\ndecisions about which subsequent experiments to conduct, such as focusing on particular\nstages for gene expression analysis or investigating downstream effects during critical\ndevelopmental windows.\n\nThis example showcases how Prophet is flexible enough to extend beyond cell lines and in vitro\nexperiments to in vivo phenotypes. In the future, Prophet could be provided with genetically\northologous data in human developmental models to bridge the gap between controlled\nlaboratory experiments and complex in vivo systems, helping to translate findings from basic\nresearch into humans and potential therapeutic applications.\n\n## Discussion\n\nProphet introduces a novel and scalable approach for phenotypic experimental biology,\nleveraging transfer learning to effectively predict outcomes across a diverse range of biological\nexperiments. It significantly outperforms simpler architectures and the mean baseline in\nprediction on unseen experimental conditions (Fig. 2b, fig. S5c). Prophet learns a biologically\nmeaningful experimental space that can be explored to generate new hypotheses. For instance,\nProphet\u2019s precise predictions allow users to make screens 60x smaller while identifying the\nsame number of hits (Fig. 2f). Activity-based compound fingerprints made possible by Prophet\naccurately recover known biological pathways, with predictions validating in vitro. Notably,\nProphet's capabilities extend beyond cell lines to encompass predictions for in vivo settings (Fig.\n5), laying the groundwork for systematic phenotypic drug discovery even in complex biological\nsystems. These evaluations underscore Prophet's potential as a first step towards a foundation\nmodel for experimental biology, highlighted by its scaling properties, transfer learning\n\ncapabilities, and performance on extensive datasets gathered.\n\nLimitations of the current approach are, firstly, the simplified assumption of the three-axis\nexperimental space (Fig. 1). There exist other elements that define an experiment, such as a\ntemporal dimension or the dosage employed, as well as more subtle variations such as\ntechnical variation or protocol choice. Prophet considers the time point at which an experiment\nis measured to be a specification of the readout, without considering the ordinal nature of the\nvariable. Drug dosage could be considered similarly, and these should add ordinal dimensions\nto experimental space as a topic of future development. Similarly, Prophet could take as input\ndirectly the genetic sequences or chemical structures of the treatments, without any\n\npreprocessing, or extend to antibody treatments with the appropriate representation and\ndataset. While Prophet can currently be applied to genetic perturbation datasets, fully leveraging\nits transfer learning capabilities will require incorporation of more extensive phenotypic datasets\n\n\n-----\n\nof genetic perturbations. With future genetic intervention data and joint datasets, Prophet is\nposed to effectively translate knowledge between genetic screens and small molecule assays.\n\nWhile Prophet successfully transfers learning between independent assays and phenotypes, a\nchallenge that remains unsolved is how to transfer learning across scales\u2014between in vitro, in\n_vivo and patient assays. Mastering this transfer is crucial for improving clinical outcomes in drug_\ndiscovery because more complex functional assays, using organoids, patient samples, or in vivo\nexperiments can often be limited in size. If supplied with this data, the Prophet architecture and\nframework would enable more accurate predictions by transferring information from scalable in\n_vitro perturbation screens, up the chain of complexity to different biological contexts._\n\nProphet represents a new concept in phenotypic drug discovery, demonstrating that transfer\nlearning between independent assays is not only possible but also enhances results. Its\nanalysis capabilities and general architecture position it as a step towards establishing a\nfoundation model for perturbation biology: a comprehensive unified model that integrates\ndiverse types of information under a single learning paradigm. Prophet's methodology allows it\nto be used as a backbone for a lab-in-the-loop system to propose the next set of perturbational\nexperiments, guiding phenotypic drug discovery and navigating the vast experimental space.\nThese attributes make Prophet a powerful tool for driving progress in biological research and\nexperimental design.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Materials and Methods\n\n**_External datasets_**\n\nWe selected datasets with at least 100 clearly labeled cell states or treatments. In most cases,\nwe used as the predictand the least processed values post-batch correction generated by the\noriginal authors. The contents of each dataset are detailed in Table S1.\n\nAll datasets then underwent the following: where the original authors did not collapse replicates,\nreplicates were averaged. Experimental outcome values were scaled from 0 to 1. Cell lines,\ntreatments, and readouts which do not exist in the input lookup files were excluded from both\ntraining and test. As small molecules were represented using their SMILES strings, small\nmolecules without SMILES strings or with ambiguous SMILES strings were filtered out.\n\n**_Baseline models_**\n\nThe baseline models we employ are linear regression, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and\nRandom Forest. As some experiments are combinations of treatments and the baselines are\nnot permutation invariant, all datasets are duplicated and the treatments flipped. This means\nthat an observation \ud835\udc4b = {\ud835\udc4b, {\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 }, \ud835\udc4b } is also seen as\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc63 1 2 \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\n\n\ud835\udc4b = {\ud835\udc4b, {\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 }, \ud835\udc4b }. For the linear regression setting, L1 and L2 regularization are\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc63 2 1 \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\n\ntested but just the best results are reported. Random Forest runs with 100 estimators, minimum\nsamples per split=2 and without capping the max length.\n\n**_Benchmarks of performance evaluation_**\n\nWe distinguish between two distinct evaluation scenarios: unseen treatments and unseen cell\nstates. While both are similar, they differ in their respective axes of the experimental space. For\nunseen treatments, we construct a hold-out test dataset comprising entirely new treatments. For\ncombinatorial datasets including zebrafish, this means any combination including the unseen\ntreatment is placed in test. For unseen cell states, we construct a hold-out test dataset\ncomprising experiments in entirely new cell states. In both scenarios, the test dataset represents\n20% of the total treatments or cell lines, while the validation dataset encompasses 10% of them.\n\nImportantly, in the case of fine tuning a pretrained Prophet model, we ensure that there is no\ndata leakage or any data split issue confounding the performance by maintaining consistent\ntrain and test splits between the large pre-trained model and the assay-specific models.\n\nAdditionally, we examine the model's performance as it is exposed to progressively more\ntreatments or cell lines. Specifically, we assess Prophet\u2019s performance with 80%, 50%, 30%,\n20%, 10%, and 5% of the treatments or cell lines included in the training dataset.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Overview of Prophet_**\n\n\ud835\udc41\n\nProphet considers a perturbational dataset of \ud835\udc41 experiments \ud835\udc37= {(\ud835\udc4b, \ud835\udc4c )} where \ud835\udc4b\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc56\n\n\ud835\udc3e\n\nrepresents the experiment carried out and \ud835\udc4c \u2208 \ud835\udc45 is the \ud835\udc58-dimensional functional outcome\n\ud835\udc56\n\nresultant of the experiment.

This learning process involves non-linear\ntransforming, using feed-forward networks, prior representations if available; otherwise, it\n\n0\n\nresorts to transforming simple one-hot encodings.

For example, choosing a\n\nrepresentation of cancer cell lines which only spans 100 cell lines would limit predictions to\nthose 100 cell lines. As such, we used bulk RNA-seq from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia\n[(CCLE) (31) from Dependency Map, which covers 1406 cell lines. Further details can be found](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/QaFU)\nin Table S1.\n\nFor the one perturbation dataset performed in zebrafish embryos, we consider each cell type as\na different tissue. To do so, we used the pseudo-bulked expression of the cell type in a control\nembryo across all time points as the cell state representation.\n\nTo reduce training time, we reduced the dimensionality of both sources using PCA to 300\ncomponents.\n\n**_Treatment representations_**\n\nAll assays examined in this study involve perturbations induced by either CRISPR or small\nmolecules. Hence, the prior representations of each class of perturbations are different to gather\nthe relevant aspect of each. In both cases, however, the different representations are\nconcatenated.\n\nFor CRISPR treatments (including KO, interference, and activation), we use the target gene to\nrepresent the treatment. We further go on to use two orthogonal sources of information to\nrepresent a target gene - its co-expression patterns across cell lines, and its coding sequence.\nCo-expression pattern representation is derived from CCLE. The coding sequence\n\nrepresentation is derived from Enformer embeddings for the whole transcription sequence.\n\n\n-----\n\nEnformer embeddings are derived from the second to last layer of the model. The genomic\ncoordinates of GRCh38 (hg38) were extracted using the BioMart Data Mining tool. In this\nprocess, we selected the Human genes GRCh38.p14 dataset and only included genes with an\nHGNC symbol ID. For genes with multiple transcripts, we retained the coordinate with the\nsmallest Transcription Start Site (TSS). Subsequently, we retrieved the corresponding gene\nsequences from the GRCh38 human reference sequence produced by the Genome Reference\nConsortium.\n\nFor small molecules, we use the canonical SMILES string to represent the treatment. We further\n[go on to use different representations of molecular structure - RDKit2D(32) molecular graph](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/LUH0)\nembeddings and Morgan fingerprint [embeddings(33).](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/8CWo) RDKit embeddings produced a\n\n200-dimensional vector, while the Morgan fingerprints were calculated as 1024-dimensional\nvectors with radius fixed at 3. Specifically, we use 195 dimensions that represent the RDKit2D\nfingerprints and 1024 dimensions for the Morgan fingerprints. In cases in which two datasets\nused the same common name for a compound but attached different SMILES, we appended a\nsuffix to the compound name (e.g. imatinib_GDSC and imatinib_PRISM) to differentiate\nbetween the two.\n\n**_Phenotype representations_**\n\nPhenotypes are typically learned from scratch without any prior knowledge-based\n\nrepresentation, primarily due to the challenge of identifying a meaningful prior that accurately\nreflects the phenotype. Hence, phenotype representations are modeled as learnable\n\nembeddings and developed during training.\n\n**_In vivo phenotype prediction_**\n\nIn the case of the cell type proportion in the zebrafish dataset, we do not use the pretrained\nProphet version since it is a completely different organism than the ones in the pretraining\ncorpus data and the data representations fundamentally change.\n\nIn this case, we use a timepoint representation which is the vector of cell type proportions of the\ncontrol embryos at that timepoint. The cell state embedding is constructed by subsetting to\ncontrol embryos, computing the top 300 highly variable genes, and then taking the pseudobulk\nRNA expression of the cell type. The treatment embedding is constructed from the 300\ncomponent PCA of the transposed cell x gene matrix of the control embryos, exactly as was\ndone for the human CRISPR treatment embedding. Finally, each readout is the cell type\nproportion after a given F0 knockout at a given time t. To ensure no data leakage in evaluation,\nthe cell type proportions of the control embryos are never used in test or validation.\n\n**_Model training_**\n\n\n-----\n\nProphet is efficiently trained in a single Nvidia A100 40GB GPU. We train the model using\n[float32 precision. We use the AdamW optimizer(68) with](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/OFVQ3) \u03b2 and \u03b2 99, weight\n1 = 0. 9 2 = 0. 9\n\ndecay of 0.01, and dropout of 0.1. The batch size is 4096 in the case of the model training\nacross all assays, while it depends on the size of the dataset in the case of the smaller\nexperiments. The learning rate increases linearly until 1e-4 with a linear warmup of 10,000\n[steps. After the warmup, a cosine decay regime(69) is applied. All weights are initialized using](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/JSMdP)\n[Xavier initialization(70) with default parameters, while the bias terms are initialized to 0. It is run](https://paperpile.com/c/giCuWv/Wje1S)\nwith an early stopping with patience of 20 epochs. During pre-training, it tracks the average R2\nperformance in the validation set per assay. However, we have noted that model selection after\na sufficient number of pre-training epochs does not change results significantly. For fine-tuning,\nthe early stopping tracks the dataset-specific R2 in the validation set. During fine-tuning, all\nparameters of Prophet are updated during 20.000 steps with a batch size of 256 observations.\n\nThe pre-trained Prophet model consists of 8 transformer encoder units with 8 attention heads\nper layer and a feed-forward network size of 1024 to generate a 512-dimensional embedding of\nthe experiment. However, the Prophet models trained from scratch in specific datasets are much\nsmaller (2-4 layers and 1-4 attention heads). This is because using a large model in\ndataset-specific cases resulted in significant overfitting (Supplementary Methods).\n\n**_Uncertainty_**\n\nWith the exception of zebrafish development, we compute an uncertainty value for Prophet\u2019s\npredictions by training six individual models on all datasets. Each model maintains the same\ntest set, but the validation set (and therefore the training set) is selected using an arbitrary seed.\nAs Prophet generally exhibits very stable behavior when learning representations robustly\nrepresented in the data, the variance of these predictions can be used as a measure of the\nuncertainty of the model.\n\nWe take a similar approach to computing uncertainty in zebrafish development, but because the\nzebrafish dataset has no overlap with any existing dataset, we compute uncertainty using\ndifferent test and validation genes with a model trained on only this dataset.\n\n### Code and data availability\n\n[The code for Prophet can be found at https://github.com/theislab/prophet.

Base-level errors\nare typically fixed with an additional polishing step that uses reads aligned to the draft assembly\nto identify necessary edits. However, current methods struggle to find a balance between overand under-polishing. Here, we present an encoder-only transformer model for assembly\npolishing called DeepPolisher, which predicts corrections to the underlying sequence using\nPacbio HiFi read alignments to a diploid assembly. Our pipeline introduces a method,\nPHARAOH (Phasing Reads in Areas Of Homozygosity), which uses ultra-long ONT data to\nensure alignments are accurately phased and to correctly introduce heterozygous edits in\nfalsely homozygous regions. We demonstrate that the DeepPolisher pipeline can reduce\nassembly errors by half, with a greater than 70% reduction in indel errors. We have applied our\nDeepPolisher-based pipeline to 180 assemblies from the next Human Pangenome Reference\nConsortium (HPRC) data release, producing an average predicted Quality Value (QV)\nimprovement of 3.4 (54% error reduction) for the majority of the genome.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nFaithful reconstruction of the genome is increasingly essential for scientists to understand the\nunderlying biology of any organism. Genome assembly, the process of digitally reconstructing a\ngenome, is accomplished by piecing together segments of DNA (called sequencing \u201creads\u201d) and\nobtaining a consensus. The past several years have seen a huge improvement in the quality of\ngenome assembly, driven by long-read sequencing technology, which produces reads that are\n[orders of magnitude longer than the short-read technologies that preceded them. Assembly](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?SEnYYE)\nalgorithms have continued to advance alongside the improvements in sequencing, and it is now\nbecoming routine to produce automated, fully-phased, highly contiguous, and near-complete\n[genome assemblies.](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?5g47Lo)\n\nThe quality of a genome assembly can be measured by an array of different metrics that assess\ndifferent aspects of the reconstruction. Contiguity metrics describe the cumulative length and\nnumber of contigs of the assembly, while completeness metrics evaluate the extent of the\n[expected sequence present in the assembly. For organisms with multiple copies of their](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?6yj5yK)\nchromosomes (ploidy), fully resolving the haplotypes is a key component to accurate genome\n[assembly, and chromosome phasing metrics assess this. Another critical set of metrics](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?17Ka5c)\n[evaluates the base-level accuracy of the assembled sequence.](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?mntweY)\n\nAll sequencing technologies contain errors which are not completely random, but are influenced\nby biases towards different genomic features. Even using a consensus approach, recurrent\nerrors in the reads can propagate into the assembly. Low complexity regions like homopolymers\n[and tandem repeats are particularly challenging for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?5UhU8q) and\n[Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-reads, and certain motifs such as those high in GC content](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?mAWx6T)\n[can cause dropout, a phenomenon particularly prevalent in short-reads like Illumina. Small](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Aox84w)\nerrors can also be introduced by biases in the assembler, and different assembly algorithms\n[differ in their limitations and error characteristics.](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?TaxKE5)\n\nBase-level errors interfere with scientists' ability to make accurate conclusions from their data.\nFor example, they can disrupt functional elements, as in protein coding genes, leading to\n[frameshifts, missense, and nonsense mutations. For projects like the Human Pangenome](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?K9hODp)\n[Reference Consortium (HPRC)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?P3RpaQ) [and Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP), whose goal is to](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?huF1D9)\nproduce haplotype-resolved population-scale reference genomes for entire groups of species,\nfixing errors is especially critical to avoid propagating mistakes to all the downstream analyses\nthat make use of them, for example, by proposing sequence variations that are in fact\n[errors.](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?OB8ns3)\n\nThe process of removing these small-scale errors in draft assemblies is known as \u201cpolishing\u201d.\nMost methods for assembly polishing involve aligning reads back to the draft assembly to\nidentify potential sequence changes suggested by the reads. Some methods employ heuristic\n[algorithms, specialized models, or repurpose variant callers to identify polishing edits. In](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?kGmBX3)\norder to polish CHM13 (an effectively haploid cell line), the T2T consortium leveraged\n\n\n-----\n\n[DeepVariant](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rSd7VY) calls from multiple sequencing technologies and a careful filtering strategy to\n[avoid false positive polishing edits. A major challenge for all polishing approaches is striking](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?oVFbCC)\na balance between overcorrecting and under-correcting assemblies, due to the complex nature\nof sequencing and assembly error profiles.\n\nHere we present a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) transformer-based method for assembly\npolishing. Seq2seq transformer family models have been used to great success in many\napplications including language processing, machine translation tasks, and conversational\n[AI. Previously this model architecture was used in DeepConsensus to improve the quality of](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?1gr40K)\n[PacBio High-Fidelity (HiFi) sequencing reads. In this work, we demonstrate a new adaptation](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?hI1TY1)\nof the transformer model for genome polishing called DeepPolisher, which takes HiFi\nsequencing reads aligned to a draft assembly as input. Along with DeepPolisher, we have\ndeveloped a pipeline called PHARAOH for improving the phasing accuracy of HiFi read\nalignments to diploid assemblies in falsely homozygous regions using ONT ultra-long (UL)\nreads. In this work, we show that DeepPolisher with PHARAOH outperforms current polishing\napproaches. Using an alignment-based measure of accuracy we demonstrate that\nDeepPolisher reduces assembly errors by half, driven mostly by reductions in assembly\ninsertion-deletion (indel) errors. We applied our pipeline to 180 haplotype-resolved assemblies\nfrom the next HPRC data release, and show substantial improvements in accuracy, increasing\nthe predicted quality value (QV) by 3.4 for most of the genome.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_______________________________________________________________________________________________**\n**Figure 1: DeepPolisher pipeline overview.**\nThe PHARAOH pipeline leverages phase block information from ONT UL reads to correct the haplotype\nassignment of PacBio HiFi reads. The corrected alignment is passed to DeepPolisher, which is an\nencoder-only transformer model that predicts the underlying assembly sequence and proposes\ncorrections in vcf format.\n**________________________________________________________________________________________________________**\n\n\n## Results\n\n\n-----\n\n**Overview of the DeepPolisher pipeline**\nAn overview of the DeepPolisher pipeline is shown in Figure 1. First, PacBio HiFi reads are\n[aligned to the diploid assembly with minimap2](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?tvtmTL) [or winnowmap. For most of the genome, this](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4n2FNU)\nalignment step is sufficient to assign the HiFi reads to the correct haplotype. However, a\ncommon error mode of modern assemblers is to mistakenly represent heterozygous sequence\nas homozygous. When these regions of false homozygosity are longer than the HiFi read (up to\n~ 25kb), the aligner cannot phase it, and will randomly assign it to a haplotype, preventing any\nnecessary polishing edits from being made there. To address this, we developed a pipeline\ncalled PHARAOH (PHAsing Reads in Areas Of Homozygosity) which uses phasing information\nfrom ONT reads greater than 100 kb to infer the correct haplotype for reads in long homozygous\n[regions (Methods). For the rest of the genome, the tool Secphase](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?GhsJYO) is used within the\nPHARAOH pipeline to ensure correct read phasing by revisiting secondary alignments and\ncalculating a marker consistency score to determine whether the read should be relocated to\nthe other haplotype.\n\nPHARAOH and Secphase allow us to provide improved read alignments as input to the\nDeepPolisher model. DeepPolisher first partitions these alignments into 100 bp segments, then\nrepresents them as a tensor object with auxiliary input features consisting of the base, whether\nthe base is a match or mismatch to the assembly, the base quality, and the mapping quality. The\ntensor is provided to the encoder-only transformer neural network, which produces proposed\nassembly corrections in vcf format. These can be applied to the unpolished assembly with\n[bcftools](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Z06TCL) consensus (Figure 1). To train DeepPolisher we used a high accuracy assembly of\n[HG002 produced by the Q100 consortium](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?lv96kY) (v0.9), training across chromosomes 1-19\n(Methods). DeepPolisher can be run without PHARAOH if ONT UL reads are not available,\nhowever assembly corrections in long stretches of false homozygosity will not be made.\n\n\n-----\n\n**________________________________________________________________________________________________________**\n**Figure 2: Comparison of DeepPolisher and alternate polishing methods against GIAB v4.2.1**\n**benchmark for HG005**\n**A) For each polishing method, GIAB v4.2.1 variant calling (assembly) errors are separated by indels**\n(darker shade) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (lighter shade), with the number of errors per\nmegabase to the right of each bar.

To test them, we ran the UL version of Hifiasm](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?EBymys) (which uses both\nHiFi and ONT UL reads) to generate an assembly for a sample that was not included in our\ntraining set (HG005). We polished it with each method, then called variants relative to GRCh38\n[using dipcall, which enabled us to assess concordance with the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?wDCiuR)\n[v4.2.1 benchmark call set](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4Jptc0) (Methods). This gives an alignment-based measure of polishing\n\n\n-----\n\naccuracy that spans approximately 80% of the HG005 genome, as defined by the GIAB\nconfident regions.\n\nWith DeepPolisher, we reduce the number of variant calling errors in the unpolished assembly\nfrom 20,274 to 11,750, indicating a reduction in assembly error rate by 43% (8.14 errors per Mb\nto 4.72 errors per Mb) (Figure 2A). This performance is reproduced on the held-out\nchromosome (20) from HG002 (Supplementary Table 1A,1B). We also trained a DeepPolisher\n[model on a Verkko](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?PZmyOJ) assembly using the same data. According to the GIAB variant calling\nresults, the Verkko assembly for HG005 starts out at a higher quality than Hifiasm (6.86 errors /\nMb), but after DeepPolisher we bring it to the same quality as Hifiasm after polishing at 4.87\nerrors / Mb (Supplementary Table 1E).\n\nIn comparison to DeepPolisher, the T2T polishing pipeline produces more conservative\nimprovements, with only 3,591 polishing edits passing their filters, leading to a removal of 372\nerrors (7.99 errors / Mb). Using DeepVariant to polish with HiFi alignments reduces assembly\nerrors to 13,724 (5.51 errors / Mb). We note that much of the difference in GIAB variant calling\nperformance between DeepVariant and DeepPolisher on HG005 is due to PHARAOH: polishing\nthe HG005 assembly with DeepVariant run on PHARAOH alignments produces a reduction to\n11,508 assembly errors (4.62 errors / Mb). However, an important caveat is that DeepVariant\nwas trained on several GIAB samples including HG005, with only chr20-22 held out. Finally,\nNextPolish2 removed 3,260 errors from the unpolished assembly (6.68 errors / Mb) (Figure 2A,\n**Supplementary Table 1C).**\n\nWe tested DeepPolisher across a variety of coverages, and found that while 40x coverage\nproduces optimal reduction in variant calling errors, some assembly improvement can still be\nobtained with as low as 10x coverage (Figure 2B). The DeepPolisher pipeline performance is\nalso reproducible across HiFi read versions other than what it was trained on (DeepConsensus\nv1.2). This includes Sequel II, DeepConsensus v0.2, and Revio with DeepConsensus\nv1.1(Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 2).\n\nWe stratified the GIAB variant calling errors by genomic region and found that the majority of\nindel errors removed by DeepPolisher were in tandem repeats and homopolymers. The majority\nof SNV errors that were not fixed by DeepPolisher were located within segmental duplications.\nSome of these may be true errors, but others may be mapping artifacts or mistakes in the truth\nset (Figure 2C).\n\nTo test how DeepPolisher impacts critical coding regions, we looked for nonsynonymous,\nframeshift, or premature stop mutations in the HG005 assembly before and after polishing.\nDeepPolisher removed two frameshifts, four nonsynonymous mutations, and one premature\nstop codon (Supplementary Table 12).\n\nWe ran DeepPolisher directly on minimap2 alignments to assess the performance benefits of\nthe PHARAOH pipeline. DeepPolisher on PHARAOH alignments results in 1,915 fewer variant\n\n\n-----\n\ncalling errors for HG002 (whole genome) and 519 less errors for HG005 (Supplementary Table\n**1B, 1G).**\n\n**________________________________________________________________________________________________________**\n**Figure 3: K-mer based comparison of DeepPolisher and alternate polishing approaches for HG005**\n**A) Top panels display QV scores for each polishing method.

D) Number of error k-mers unchanged by polishing with DeepPolisher\nfalling into sequence annotation categories.\n**________________________________________________________________________________________________________**\n\n**K-mer based comparison of DeepPolisher and alternate polishing methods**\n[K-mer based methods assess the accuracy of an assembly using an alignment-free approach.](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?7lz3sY)\nTo compare the k-mer and alignment based assessments we first restricted the k-mer\nassessment to just the assembled sequence contained within the GIAB high confidence\nregions, which span ~80% of the HG005 assembly (Methods). K-mer methods generally report\na quality value (QV), a log base 10 scaled measure of assembly error, with higher values\nindicating more accurate assemblies. We find that DeepPolisher improves the k-mer based\nassembly QV by 1.8, equivalent to a 34% reduction in errors, which is approximately consistent\nwith the quantity of improvement suggested by the GIAB variant calling performance (Figure\n**3A, Supplementary Table 6). Out of all the polishing methods compared, DeepPolisher**\ninduces the least amount of error k-mers to the assembly (Figure 3A). NextPolish2, which uses\nIllumina k-mers in its algorithm for assembly polishing, produces the highest QV improvement,\nyet with the trade-off of inducing the highest number of new error k-mers to the assembly. The\nintroduction of new error k-mers likely lies behind the increase in switch and hamming error rate\nproduced by NextPolish2 (.03% and .06% respectively). In contrast, the other polishing methods\nmanage to reduce switch and hamming error rates (Figure 3B).\n\nTo compare the performance of DeepVariant and DeepPolisher on samples that were\ncompletely held out from training in both methods, we applied both tools to the same PHARAOH\nalignments for eight of the HPRC samples, and assessed their QV. For all samples,\nDeepPolisher produces a higher QV improvement (avg. 3.95 QV, 60% error reduction) within\nthe confidence regions compared with DeepVariant (avg 2.26 QV, 41% error reduction) (Figure\n**3C). In addition, the percentage of edits inducing error k-mers is more than twice as high for**\nDeepVariant (average 9%) than DeepPolisher (average 4%) (Figure 3C).\n\n**K-mer based assessments underestimate assembly error rates**\nRelative to alignment-based metrics like those used in the GIAB assessment above,\nk-mer-based QVs are unbiased by alignment and easy to assess. However, k-mer based\nmethods lack an underlying ground truth, instead relying on consistency between assembly and\nsequencing technology. This results in a potential limitation where results could be consistent\nbut not correct due to technology-specific sequencing bias. Because k-mer based quality\nmetrics are agnostic to the sequence context outside of the k-mer window, they also are limited\nin their ability to capture errors in repetitive sequence or in regions with a loss of heterozygosity.\n\nFor the unpolished HG005 assembly within the confident regions, we see a QV estimate of\n66.97 using Illumina k-mers (k-31), suggesting 0.811 errors / Mb, while the GIAB analysis\nsuggests the same assembly has ~10x more errors per Mb (8.14) (equivalent to a QV of 50.9)\n**(Supplementary Table 6). Using shorter k-mer sizes or a hybrid k-mer set built with both**\n[Illumina and HiFi reads as suggested by McCartney et. al](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rFYkWL) led to substantially more inflated\nestimates of accuracy (0.258 and 0.201 errors / Mb, respectively) (Methods, Supplementary\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 6). In order to explore the source of this difference in error rate, we performed a manual**\nanalysis investigating the concordance between the errors reported by the QV and the GIAB\nvariants for HG005 after polishing with DeepPolisher (Methods, Supplementary Table 13). We\nfound that error k-mers reported by QV were almost always validated by errors reported using\nGIAB, indicating that most of the QV errors within the confident regions are likely true. However,\nfor 35% of the cases examined, the QV did not flag the pre- nor post-polishing sequence as an\nerror. Because it is impossible for both versions of the assembly sequence to be correct, we\nattribute this to the fact that k-mer based quality estimates often miss errors in repetitive\nsequences, due to their presence in the \u201ctruth\u201d k-mer set coming from other regions of the\ngenome. Therefore, we conclude that non-unique sequence is likely the cause of the\nunderestimated error rates in QV metrics.\n\n**K-mer based methods identify residual errors in unpolished sequence**\nLooking at the k-mer QV whole genome we found little difference between the unpolished\nassembly and the four different polishing methods, with all QV scores in the range of 50.56 50.84. This is because the vast majority of the error k-mers leading to this QV score are\nunchanged after polishing (97.3% for DeepPolisher) (Figure 3A). Investigating these\nunchanged error k-mers, we found that 41% have greater than 70% GC content, and when we\nplotted the distribution of their GC content we saw a clear bias relative to randomly permuted\n[k-mers (Methods, Supplementary Figure 4). This indicates that the observed GC bias](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?DNsLJK) in\nshort reads is likely inducing a substantial number of falsely reported errors. However, this still\nleaves a majority of these error k-mers that may be real, unaddressed errors. Indeed, we find\nthat 22.8% of predicted error k-mers are located in regions with less than 5x coverage of HiFi\ndata. These regions were likely bridged by ONT sequence in the assembly stage, and therefore\nhave a higher error rate, but are inaccessible to DeepPolisher due to the lack of HiFi read\ncoverage. Additionally, we found that 36% of the unchanged error k-mers overlapped simple\nand low-complexity repeat annotations, with 10% overlapping homopolymers greater than 10\n[bp. These regions tend to have higher error rates in HiFi reads, which makes it likely these](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bG2Or2)\nare true errors that DeepPolisher was unable to fix. Together, these observations indicate that\nwhile the residual predicted error k-mers contain many false positives, the k-mer based methods\nare identifying significant sequence outside of GIAB high-confident regions that are erroneous\nand unchanged by our current polishing methods (Figure 3D, Supplementary Table 7).\n\n\n-----\n\n**________________________________________________________________________________________________________**\n**Figure 4: Polishing results for 180 HPRC assemblies**\n**A) Hap1 QV (x axis) and Hap2 QV (y axis) in the confidence regions for 180 HPRC samples from the**\nsecond release.

Within the confident regions (81.4% of the genome on average),\nand consistent with our analysis of HG005, we noted an average QV improvement of 3.4 (54%\nreduction in errors), with the average unpolished QV of 66.66 moving to an average of 70.05\nafter polishing (Figure 4A). Whole genome, we improved the QV by 0.306 points on average\n(Figure 4B; 7% reduction in errors), owing to the presence of the lower quality ONT-only\nregions that cannot be polished with the current model, and regions subject to sequencing bias\nas previously discussed. Polishing improved phasing accuracy for all 111 samples that\ncontained trio data: on average it reduced switch error by 0.039 and hamming errors by 0.037\n**(Figure 4C).**\n\n**Removing additional errors with Element data**\nElement Biosciences Avidity short-read data has gained popularity recently for its high accuracy\nin tandem repeats and homopolymers. We tested whether further polishing with Element data\nafter DeepPolisher could fix residual errors. Because of the challenges associated with phasing\nshort read data, we restricted our initial experiment to polishing just homozygous locations. In\n[order to obtain potential homozygous edits, we aligned 50x Element cloudbreak reads](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?i3X2Ly) to each\nhaplotype of the HG002 and HG005 polished assemblies. We ran DeepVariant on each\nalignment, and selected just the homozygous-alternate calls with a GQ greater than 7. This\napproach removed 9% (1,182) of the remaining variant calling errors after polishing with\nDeepPolisher for HG002, and 5% (600) for HG005, a promising number of errors removed\n\n\n-----\n\ngiven the relatively low number of polishing edits applied (5,586 for HG002 and 8,795 for\nHG005) (Supplementary Table 11).\n\n## Discussion:\n\nRapid advancements in long-read sequencing and assembly algorithms in recent years are\n[ushering in a new era of population-scale, T2T genome assembly projects. Many of these](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?z0BYDT)\nassemblies are being used as reference genomes, making it important that the sequences be\nhighly accurate. To remove the remaining errors in these sequences, deep learning approaches\nare a promising way to model sequencing bias in regions like homopolymers and\nlow-complexity repeats. In this work, we developed a new polishing tool called DeepPolisher, an\nencoder-only transformer model, that takes in HiFi reads aligned to a diploid assembly, and\npredicts the underlying sequence. Accompanying this, we introduced a pipeline called\nPHARAOH (PHAsing Reads in Areas of Homozygosity) that ensures read alignment inputs to\nDeepPolisher are assigned to the correct haplotype, and phases potential polishing edits in long\nhomozygous assembly regions.\n\nUsing an alignment based assessment of assembly accuracy measured against the GIAB\nv4.2.1 benchmarking variant calls, we demonstrate that DeepPolisher reduces assembly errors\nby approximately half, largely driven by reductions in indel errors, across the large majority of\nsequence that is mappable by HiFi sequencing. While alignment-based assessments of\nhigh-quality benchmark sets are close to a gold standard, current benchmarks do not cover the\nfull genome and are dependent on accurate alignment. To get around these issues we also\nassessed assembly quality with k-mer methods. Comparing k-mer methods to the\nalignment-based assessment within the same genomic regions predicted similar percentage\nreductions in errors, which is consistent and reassuring, but also revealed that the k-mer\nmethods miss around 90% or more of residual errors. While some of these may be false\npositives in the alignment benchmark, our manual analysis suggests that most are simply\nmissed by the k-mer methods due to their limitations regarding modeling repeat k-mers that are\nlikely often enriched in assembly errors. We would therefore urge users to recognize this and\nnote that such QV estimates are likely overly optimistic because they have a high false negative\nrate.\n\nHowever, k-mer methods also reveal large numbers of predicted errors in regions that remain\nuntouched with the current iteration of DeepPolisher and are located outside of the regions\nassessed by the alignment based benchmarks. While nearly half of these predicted errors may\nbe false positives caused by GC content bias, it is probable that many are real. We attribute a\nquarter of these errors to regions of HiFi coverage dropout where ONT was primarily used\nduring the assembly stage. We plan to expand the DeepPolisher model to work on ONT reads\nin the future, to address this fraction of errors. Around a third of the residual errors lie in\nhomopolymers and tandem repeats, sequences that are challenging even for highly accurate\nHiFi reads. We experimented with using Element Biosciences data to fix these errors and\ndemonstrate that we can remove a minority of errors using the approach. However, Element\n\n\n-----\n\nreads are currently relatively short, preventing accurate mapping across repetitive sequence\nand limiting phasing. We predict the remaining class of errors will be challenging to fix.\n\nTo resolve the limitations of current alignment and k-mer based approaches to assessing\n[base-level assembly accuracy, the Q100 project](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jbxgY8) aims to create a \u201cperfect\u201d genome assembly\nto be used as a benchmark for assembly methods. While achieving a completely perfect\nassembly will be challenging, the direct comparison of a draft assembly to an assembly\nbenchmark will help expand the alignment-based assessment of assembly quality to more\ndifficult regions of the genome than are covered by the GIAB confidence regions. In the future,\nwe hope that genome benchmarks for more samples will be produced, to expand the training\nand testing sets to multiple genomes for models like DeepPolisher.\n\nDespite the difficulties inherent in assessing the performance benefits of the DeepPolisher\nmodel, we demonstrate that it provides the best balance between over and under-polishing for\nhigh-quality assembly projects like the HPRC. We have applied the DeepPolisher and\nPHARAOH pipeline to the next release of HPRC assemblies, and demonstrate consistent\nimprovements to quality value across all samples, which will be critical for downstream\napplications of this new reference dataset. Next, we aim to experiment with DeepPolisher on\nnon-human species, to expand its utility to high quality genomes outside of humans, which may\n[be useful for projects like the VGP](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?TWPSiv) [and T2T primates consortium.](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?eF1WMV)\n\n## Code availability\n\nDeepPolisher code is available publicly on GitHub through\n(https://github.com/google/deeppolisher).

To create HG002 and HG005 Verkko\nassemblies for training and testing DeepPolisher, we ran Verkko v2.0 in trio mode with\n--correct-overlap-batches 64 and --screen human and otherwise default parameters. As input\nwe used 40x HiFi DeepConsensus v1.2 and 40x ONT UL >100kb reads from the HPRC. The\nONT reads for the HG005 and HG002 samples were sequenced using R9.4.1 flow cells and\nbasecalled using Guppy software (HG005 with version 5.0.7 and HG002 with version 6.0.6). For\nphasing assembly haplotypes in the trio mode, both assemblers needed k-mer databases that\nwere created from parental short reads, and Verkko required k-mer databases from the child\u2019s\nshort reads. For Hifiasm we used yak and for Verkko we used meryl to create the related k-mer\ndatabases. For HG002, we used the 300x parental and child illumina data from the HPRC to\ncreate input yak and meryl databases (using default settings for both), and 100x illumina data\nfor HG005 parental and child databases.\n\n**DeepPolisher development and training**\nDeepPolisher uses an encoder-only transformer model to predict potential errors present in a\nhaplotype-resolved genome assembly. The framework of DeepPolisher is adopted from our\n[previous work DeepConsensus. The input to DeepPolisher is an alignment file where the](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?sqE3UZ)\nreads are aligned to the correct haplotype assembly. Then it performs the following steps to\nidentify potential errors:\n\n1. **make_images: In the make_images step:**\n\n    - DeepPolisher takes a 25kb window of the assembly and tries to find potential\npositions where there could be an error. This is done by comparing the reads to\nthe assembly. If at any position, there are more than two reads containing a\n\n\n-----\n\nsequence that does not match the assembly (mismatched base, insertion or\ndeletion), we pick that position to be a potential error site.\n\n    - The positions that are within 50 bp or closer are grouped together to create a\nwindow that does not exceed 100 bp sequence.\n\n    - For each window, we take alignment features (base, base quality, mapping\nquality, match or mismatch) and create a tensor-like representation of the window\nthat potentially contains assembly errors.\n\n    - This tensor-like representation of the alignment is then fed to the\ntransformer-model for prediction.\n\n2. **inference: In the inference step, we take the tensor-like representation of the 100 bp**\nwindow with potential sequencing errors and use that as an input to the encoder-only\ntransformer model. The model predicts a sequence based on the read alignments. We\nthen compare the predicted sequence to the assembly and any difference between the\npredicted sequence and the assembly is reported in a vcf format file which would\nindicate potential errors in the assembly. These vcf edits can be applied to the assembly\n[after DeepPolisher in a separate step using bcftools](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?l2KyYV) consensus -H2.\n\n[We trained DeepPolisher on the HG002 Hifiasm assembly taking the HG002-T2T-v0.9](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?GZEZUI) as the\ntruth. We took HiFi reads aligned to the Hifiasm assembly using the PHARAOH pipeline. Then\nwe aligned the Hifiasm diploid assembly to HG002-T2T-v0.9 assembly to create an\nassembly-to-truth alignment, which we use as the truth sequence for training the model. During\ntraining, the predicted sequence is compared against the truth sequence and the loss is\n[calculated via the alignment loss function we introduced in our previous work DeepConsensus.](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?KTu2rW)\nWe use a similar approach to train a model for Verkko assembly, where we use the Verkko\nassembly for training.\n\n**PHARAOH pipeline**\nThe first step in the PHARAOH workflow involves aligning all HiFi reads to the diploid assembly\nusing minimap2 with parameters \u201c-L --eqx --cs -c -k19 -x map-hifi\u201d. Next, we identify stretches of\nhomozygosity in the assembly by aligning the two haplotype fasta files to each other with\nminimap2 using the parameters \u201c-L --eqx --cs -c -x asm5\u201d. The resulting paf file is passed into a\npython script\n(https://github.com/mobinasri/secphase/blob/main/programs/src/find_homozygous_regions.py)\nwhich parses the cigar string to return stretches of 100% identical sequence greater than 20,000\nbp (the average length of HiFi reads). Next, the reads within the homozygous regions are\nextracted and aligned separately to the maternal and paternal haplotypes using minimap2 with\nparameters \u201c-L --eqx --cs -c -k19 -map-hifi\u201d. All reads with gap-compressed mismatch ratio\nexceeding 0.02 are removed to avoid calling spurious variants in reads too diverged from the\nassembly. DeepVariant is then used to detect heterozygous variants in these alignments, and all\nvariants with a genotype quality less than 10 are filtered out. We align ONT UL reads greater\nthan 100,000 bp separately to each haplotype assembly using minimap2 with parameters `--cs\n[--eqx -L -Y -map-ont`. These UL alignments are passed to WhatsHap, which is used to phase](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?1jDQ3Z)\nthe heterozygous variants called by DeepVariant in homozygous regions.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to reassign reads to the correct haplotype assembly using the phased variants from\nWhatsHap, we added a new mode to the tool Secphase. From WhatsHap we have phased\nvariants grouped into phase blocks. Each phase block contains two haplotypes, and Secphase\npicks the haplotype with a higher number of reference alleles (in other words, the one that is\nmore similar to the assembly sequence) covered by that phase block. Secphase then retains\nthe variants with alternative alleles in the selected haplotype of the phase block. Next, a variant\nblock is created around each selected variant. The minimum block size can be set as a\nparameter (default = 100) and the actual size is adjusted to be twice the variant size if the\nminimum block size is smaller than twice the variant size. Overlapping variant blocks are\nmerged, so a single block may encompass multiple variants. Each variant block, defined in\nassembly coordinates, is then projected onto the read coordinates. A single read may have\nmultiple alignments, typically one per assembly haplotype, with each alignment having its own\nprojected blocks. To create non-overlapping blocks crucial for distinguishing assembly\nhaplotypes, all projected variant blocks are merged on the read coordinates. These merged\nblocks serve as proxies to compare haplotypes. The variants are then applied to the assembly\nhaplotypes, effectively \"pseudo-polishing\" the assembly only in the created blocks. The\npseudo-polished sequence of each haplotype is then compared against the read sequence\n[within each variant block, with edit distances calculated using the Edlib](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?gtVYXr) library. The edit\ndistances across all merged variant blocks are summed for each alignment. The haplotype with\nthe lower total edit distance is selected as the correct haplotype for the related read.\n\nIn the PHARAOH pipeline, this new variant mode of Secphase is used for the homozygous\nregions > 20 kb containing a potential heterozygous polishing edit, and the original marker mode\nis used for the rest of the genome. After reassigning reads to the new location determined by\nSecphase, we remove alignments with a gap-compressed mismatch ratio exceeding 0.002,\nproducing the final alignment for input to DeepPolisher. PHARAOH is implemented as a wdl\n[workflow, and is publically available at https://github.com/miramastoras/PHARAOH. The tool](https://github.com/miramastoras/PHARAOH)\n[Secphase may be found at https://github.com/mobinasri/Secphase. The entire pipeline for](https://github.com/mobinasri/secphase)\nrunning PHARAOH and DeepPolisher may be found at\n[https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hpp_production_workflows/tree/master/polishing.](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hpp_production_workflows/tree/master/polishing)\n\n**DeepPolisher GQ filter optimization**\nWe selected four HPRC samples (HG01975, HG04115, HG02129, HG01993) with varying QV\nimprovements after polishing (Supplementary Table 10) to optimize a set of GQ filters for\nDeepPolisher. First, we annotated the error k-mers in the assemblies by whether they were\ninduced, fixed or didn\u2019t change with polishing. To accomplish this we first aligned each\nhaplotype of the unpolished assembly to the corresponding haplotype of the polished assembly\nwith minimap2 and parameters -x asm5 -L --eqx --cs -c. We took the polished assembly\n*_only.bed file produced by Merqury (which contains the assembly coordinates for the error\n[k-mers), merged the k-mers with bedtools](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?MQ73YX) merge -c 1, and projected them to the unpolished\nassembly using the script\nhttps://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/main/programs/src/project_blocks_multi_thread.py.\nThis allowed us to have the polished assembly error k-mers in unpolished assembly\n\n\n-----\n\ncoordinates. We then subtracted the polished projected error k-mer bed file from the raw error\nk-mer bed file with bedtools subtract -A to extract the error k-mers fixed by polishing. We\nperformed the reverse to obtain the error k-mers induced by polishing. Finally, we used bedtools\nintersect to produce the error k-mers unchanged by polishing, which were common to both bed\nfiles. To annotate the polishing edits by whether they induced, fixed, or didn\u2019t change error\nk-mers, we intersected the polishing vcf with the error k-mer bed files labeled in the previous\nstep.\n\nWe found that the majority of DeepPolisher edits inducing error k-mers were 1bp insertions or\ndeletions (Supplementary Figure 4). Based on this observation, we tested three filtering\nscenarios: 1) A single GQ filter for all variants, 2) a GQ filter for 1bp insertions and a separate\none for the remaining edits, and 3) a separate GQ filter for 1bp insertions, 1bp deletions, and for\nall other edits. We combined the annotated polishing edits from all four samples, and for each of\nthese scenarios, we swept the GQ filter cutoff from 0 to 25 and calculated the estimated QV\nimprovement using the formula -10*log10(error_k-mer_after/error_k-mer_before). We found the\noptimal GQ cutoff to be GQ 20 for 1 bp insertions, GQ 12 for 1 bp deletions, and GQ 5 for all\nother variants (Supplementary table 10). All DeepPolisher results shown in the paper have this\nfilter applied unless otherwise stated. Detailed code for this analysis may be found at\n[https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/Optimizing](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/Optimizing_GQ_filters.md)\n[_GQ_filters.md.](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/Optimizing_GQ_filters.md)\n\n**Implementing alternate polishing methods**\n[We adapted the T2T polishing pipeline described in McCartney et. al](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?SVuetm) for diploid assemblies to\ncompare against DeepPolisher. We aligned 40x HiFi DeepConsensus v1.2 reads from the\nHPRC for both cell lines to the diploid Hifiasm assemblies with winnowmap v2.03 and\nparameters --cs --eqx -L -Y -I8g -map-pb. We aligned ONT R9 40x reads from the HPRC to the\ndiploid Hifiasm assembly using winnowmap v2.03 and parameters --cs --eqx -I8g -Y -L -p0.5\n-map-hifi. We also aligned 30x Illumina data to the diploid Hifiasm assembly with bwa-mem\nv.0.7.17 and default parameters. HiFi and Illumina bam files were merged with samtools, and\nDeepVariant v1.6.1 with parameter \u2013model-type=HYBRID_PACBIO_ILLUMINA was used to call\nvariants. PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant was used to call variants for the ONT alignments. All\n[GQ and VAF filters described in McCartney et al. were applied. Merfin mode -polish was also](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ElRRQv)\nused to further filter polishing edits. Edits were applied to the assembly with bcftools consensus\n-H1.\n\nWe used the same 40x HiFi DeepConsensus v1.2 winnowmap read alignments described\nabove as input to NextPolish2 and DeepVariant. For NextPolish2, 30x Illumina data from the\n[HPRC was first pre-processed with the tool fastp](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?RUyBjm) with parameters -f 5 --cut_front --cut_tail as\nsuggested by the authors. The preprocessed data was then used to create a yak k=21 and k=31\ndatabase as input to NextPolish2, using default settings. NextPolish2 was run with default\nsettings. DeepVariant v1.6.1 was run with default settings and flag --model_type=PACBIO. For\nDeepVariant, bcftools consensus -H1 was used to apply edits to the original assembly. All code\nused to implement alternate polishing methods is available at\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/alternate_](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/alternate_polishing_methods.md)\n[polishing_methods.md](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/alternate_polishing_methods.md)\n\n**Measuring GIAB variant calling performance**\nTo assess the accuracy of the assemblies against the GIAB v4.2.1 benchmark set, we first ran\n[dipcall](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?7bzStD) with default settings against GRCh38 obtained from\n(https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/references/GRCh38/). We\n[next ran the tool hap.py](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?1Y7lT6) to calculate performance metrics of the dipcall vcf file against the\nGIAB v4.2.1 benchmark vcf.\n\nFor HG002, we restricted the hap.py analysis to regions within the GIAB high confidence subset\n[that were also validated by the T2T Q100 v1.0.1](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?hICrxb) assembly. To create this subset, we ran\n[dipcall](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?LHKKFA) on the T2T v1.0.1 assembly against GRCh38 using minimap parameters\n-z200000,10000 (in order to align across larger SVs and more divergent regions like the MHC).\nWe next intersected the HG002 high confidence bed file provided by GIAB with the bed file\nproduced by dipcall in the previous step, to produce a bed file of high confidence regions that\nare alignable between GRCh38 and T2T v1.0.1. We ran hap.py on the output vcf of dipcall vcf\ncontaining variants between T2T v1.0.1 and GRCh38 against the GIAB v4.2.1 vcf, restricting the\nanalysis to the high confidence regions that are alignable between GRCh38 and T2T v1.0.1 by\npassing that bed file in with parameter -f. Using bedtools subtract we removed 50 bp\nsurrounding any FP or FN designated variants produced in that hap.py run from the GIAB high\nconfidence bed file, in order to remove regions that were not concordant with the T2T v1.0.1.\n830 total variants were subtracted, and 63.7% of them were located within the GRCh38\nsegmental duplications track. Code for this analysis may be found at\n[(https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/GIAB_trut](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/GIAB_truthset.md)\n[hset.md).](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/paper_analysis/GIAB_truthset.md)\n\nTo create the final bed file to use with hap.py -f in benchmarking the HG002 assemblies, we\nintersected the bed file containing regions concordant between the Q100 T2T v1.0.1 assembly\nand GIAB v4.2.1 (described in the previous paragraph) with the bed file produced from the\ndipcall output of the unpolished assembly to GRCh38. For HG005, we repeat this step but with\nthe original HG005 high confidence bed file provided by GIAB. For all hap.py runs we used the\noptions --pass-only --no-roc --no-json --engine=vcfeval, and the GIAB v3.3 stratifications to\nobtain performance statistics per genomic region.\n\n**Stratifying QV by whole genome and within GIAB confidence regions**\nFor QV calculations we ran Merqury and Yak with default settings, using ~30x coverage Illumina\ndata for all samples. For trio samples, we used Yak trioeval along with parental Illumina data to\ncalculate switch and hamming rates. In order to assess QV just within the confidence regions,\nwe first took an intersection of the GIAB high confidence regions for HG002 and HG005 using\nbedtools to define a subset of high confidence regions that isn\u2019t genome-specific. We aligned\neach haplotype assembly to GRCh38 with minimap2 and parameters -x asm5 -L --eqx --cs -c.\nWe then used the script\nhttps://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/main/programs/src/project_blocks_multi_thread.py to\n\n\n-----\n\nlift over the GIAB confidence regions bedfile from GRCh38 to the assembly. Next, we used\nbedtools getfasta with default settings to extract only the sequence found within this bed file,\nand passed it to Merqury and Yak for QV calculation. In order to count the number of error\nk-mers induced, fixed, or unchanged after polishing, and obtain the polishing edits which were\nthe cause of inducing, fixing, or failing to change the error k-mers, we performed the same\nannotation procedure described under the section \u201cDeepPolisher GQ filter optimization\u201d. To\ntransform QV value into an estimate of error per megabase, we used the formula (10^(-QV /\n10))* 10^6). This procedure is implemented in a wdl workflow publicly available at\n[https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/wdl/workflows/hprc_polish](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/wdl/workflows/hprc_polishing_QC.wdl)\n[ing_QC.wdl.](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_manuscript/blob/main/wdl/workflows/hprc_polishing_QC.wdl)\n\n**Manual investigation of concordance between GIAB variant calls and Illumina QV**\nWe performed a manual investigation of the concordance between the GIAB variant call errors\nand the Illumina QV reported errors for HG005 (polished by DeepPolisher) within the high\n[confidence regions using IGV. In order to obtain bed tracks for viewing the GIAB variant call](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?3jX6Gv)\n[errors in respect to the raw assembly coordinates, we used bcftools](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?UGO2ly) isec to obtain the\nintersections, unions and complements between the raw and polished vcfs output by hap.py\n(these vcfs contain variants relative to GRCh38 labelled by true-positive, false-positive or\n[false-negative). We used the tool vcf2bed from BedOps](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?uxf5pg) to convert the vcf files to bed format,\nexpanded the intervals by 10 base pairs on each side to enable projecting of the indels over to\nthe raw assembly coordinates with the script\n[https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/main/programs/src/project_blocks_multi_thread.py.](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/main/programs/src/project_blocks_multi_thread.py)\nFor viewing the QV errors in IGV, we took the *_error.bed file (containing the locations in the\nassembly of the error k-mers) produced by Merqury using Illumina k-mers of size 31, and used\nthe procedure described in \u201cDeepPolisher GQ filter optimization\u201d to annotate the polishing vcf\nby whether the edits induced, fixed, or failed to change the error k-mers, as well as label the\nerror k-mers by whether they were fixed, induced or unchanged by polishing.\n\nWe used the files described above to randomly select 10 GIAB errors induced by DeepPolisher,\n10 GIAB errors fixed by DeepPolisher, 10 polishing edits inducing error k-mers, and 10 polishing\nedits removing error k-mers. We carefully evaluated all 40 examples in IGV alongside the\nPHARAOH read alignments. For the GIAB errors we looked at both haplotypes to understand if\none or both alleles was considered an error, and in two cases there was a polishing edit made\nto both haplotypes for a given GIAB error, so edits on both haplotypes were assessed. For all 42\npolishing edits, we recorded the error status in both GIAB and QV. All details for the 42 edits\nmay be found in Supplementary Table 13.\n\nIn summary, out of 42 polishing edits manually inspected, there were 3 cases where GIAB\nindicated the edit induced an error while the QV indicated that it fixed an error. For 24 / 42\npolishing edits, the QV and GIAB metrics both agreed on whether the edit fixed or induced an\nerror. For 15 / 42 polishing edits, the QV reported no error k-mer in either the pre- or\npost-polishing sequence, indicating that both were correct according to the QV metric. Since it is\nimpossible for both versions of the sequence at a given location to be correct, this 33% of\ninspected edits likely falls in non-unique sequence, where either the pre- or post-polishing\n\n\n-----\n\nsequence is found elsewhere in the genome, so the QV failed to flag it as false. This proportion\nmay also be caused by noise from sequencing errors in the Illumina reads. In addition, all but 2\nof the 42 edits examined were found within long tandem repeats or homopolymers, which are\nmore likely to be non-unique in the genome. We propose that this category accounts for the\nmuch lower error rate reported by the QV than by the GIAB analysis within the high confidence\nregions. Because all of the QV reported errors we examined were corroborated as false by\nGIAB (and there were only 3 cases where QV indicated an error was fixed while GIAB indicated\nit was induced), we conclude that the majority of the QV errors within the confidence regions are\nmost likely true errors.\n\n**Comparing different methods for estimating QV**\nWe compared several different methods for calculating QV on our HG005 Hifiasm assembly and\n[found them to be highly variable (Supplementary Table 6). Merqury](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bZSTFi) [and Yak](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?yilWnZ) typically report\nvalues 2-3 QV points apart (approximately a 2x difference in error rate). We found that using\nk-mers of size 31 led to more conservative scores than k of 21 (between 2-4 points lower,\nequivalent to an approximately 50% difference in error rate). These longer k-mers can capture\ndifferences in longer repeats, which likely accounts for the higher predicted error rates. We also\ntested Merqury with a hybrid of HiFi and Illumina k-mers following the approach suggested in\n[McCartney et. al. We found that the hybrid k-mer database led to QV scores around 10 points](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?MsKOoW)\nhigher (a predicted order of magnitude lower error rate) than when we used just Illumina. While\nusing hybrid k-mers may remove some Illumina-specific bias, specifically known issues with\n[GC-bias, we observed that it introduces too many HiFi-specific sequencing errors to the](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?LaLuUx)\n\u201ctruth\u201d k-mer space, and so reduces the apparent error rate by masking true errors. We also\n[experimented with using Element cloudbreak](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ZPH3pq) short read k-mers to calculate QV, and found it\npredicted double the error rate relative to Illumina (Supplementary Table 6). However, we\nfound the same impact of GC bias on the error k-mers calculated by Merqury QV as was\ndescribed for Illumina. (Supplementary Figure 4). Given that Element data was not available\nfor the HPRC samples, and to be conservative, we report Merqury QV with Illumina k-mers of\nsize 31 for this paper unless otherwise stated.\n\n**Characterizing the context of unchanged error k-mers**\nAfter obtaining the error k-mers unchanged by polishing as described in the section\n\u201cDeepPolisher GQ filter optimization\u201d, we sought to establish how many were located within\ncoverage dropouts. We ran the tool mosdepth with parameter --quantize 0:5:10:150: on the\nPHARAOH alignment to obtain locations with less than 5x coverage, then bedtools intersect to\nobtain the error k-mers unchanged by polishing within those regions. To obtain the number that\nwere within simple or low complexity repeats, we ran dipcall with default parameters to align the\nHG005 raw assembly against CHM13, then the script\n[https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/main/programs/src/project_blocks_multi_thread.py to](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/main/programs/src/project_blocks_multi_thread.py)\n[project the repeat annotations produced for T2T-CHM13 at https://github.com/marbl/CHM13 to](https://github.com/marbl/CHM13)\nHG005 coordinates. We then used bedtools intersect with the unchanged error k-mers and the\nprojected repeat annotations. To calculate the GC content of all error k-mers we used bedtools\nnuc. To obtain regions in the HG005 raw assembly with homopolymers >10bp, we used a\ncustom python script which may be found at\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_project/blob/main/quantify_error_kmers_HG005.](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_project/blob/main/quantify_error_kmers_HG005.md)\n[md, and bedtools intersect.](https://github.com/miramastoras/DeepPolisher_project/blob/main/quantify_error_kmers_HG005.md)\n\n**Gene impact analysis**\nWe annotated the HG002 and HG005 assemblies before and after polishing with the\n[Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT2.0)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4VV9hZ) using the transMap and liftoff modules based on the\nGENCODE v46 gene annotations for hg38 as the reference. For these annotation sets, we\nidentified the locations of frameshifts by iterating over the coding sequence of every transcript\nand looking for gaps in the alignment. If the gap length was not a multiple of 3 or if the length\nwas longer than 30bp, the gap was determined to be a frameshift. To identify the number of\nnonsense mutations that would cause early stop codons in the annotation sets, we iterated\nthrough each codon in the coding sequence and looked for an early stop codon before the\ncanonical stop codon at the end of the transcript. To identify the number of missense or\nnonsynonymous mutations that would cause a change in the amino acid sequence produced,\nwe iterated through each codon, and for codons that were different from the canonical sequence\nin hg38, checked if the substitution of the nucleotide caused a change in the amino acid\nproduced.\n\n**Element polishing**\n[We obtained 50x element data for HG002 and HG005 from Carroll et. al](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?g6rZvQ) and aligned all reads\nto each polished haplotype assembly separately. We used DeepVariant v1.6.1 with\n--model_type=WGS to call variants. We selected only homozygous alt PASS variants with\ngenotype quality greater than 7, and applied them to the assembly with bcftools consensus -H\n2.

Thornton \n\n#### Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES) and array genotyping with imputation (IMP) are common strategies for assessing genetic variation and its association with medically relevant phenotypes. To date, there has been no systematic empirical assessment of the yield of these approaches when applied to hundreds of thousands of samples to enable the discovery of complex trait genetic signals. Using data for 100 complex traits from 149,195 individuals in the UK Biobank, we systematically compare the relative yield of these strategies in genetic association studies. We fnd that WGS and WES combined with arrays and imputation (WES + IMP) have the largest association yield. Although WGS results in an approximately fvefold increase in the total number of assayed variants over WES + IMP, the number of detected signals difered by only 1% for both single-variant and gene-based association analyses. Given that WES + IMP typically results in savings of lab and computational time and resources expended per sample, we evaluate the potential benefts of applying WES + IMP to larger samples. When we extend our WES + IMP analyses to 468,169 UK Biobank individuals, we observe an approximately fourfold increase in association signals with the threefold increase in sample size. We conclude that prioritizing WES + IMP and large sample sizes rather than contemporary short-read WGS alternatives will maximize the number of discoveries in genetic association studies.\n\n\nLarge-scale genetic studies provide insight into the biological underpinnings of a wide range of human traits, guiding the development of new\ntherapeutic interventions and disease prevention strategies through\nimproved understanding of human health and disease. Examples of\nnew therapies enabled by genetic studies include blocking PCSK9 for\nthe prevention of recurrent heart disease[\u2013], blocking ANGPTL3 for the\ntreatment of familial hypercholesterolemia and CRISPR editing of\n_BCL11A for the treatment of sickle cell disease[,]. Genetic association_\n\n\nstudies can now include extensive health data across millions of participants and have a choice of diverse approaches for capturing genetic\nvariation, ranging from array genotyping with imputation (IMP) to\nWES to WGS. Each of these approaches differs in the number and type\nof variants captured, the fidelity of information provided and the cost\nand complexity of execution. However, the impact of choosing each\napproach on the detection of actionable genetic association signals\nremains unclear.\n\n\nA full list of affiliations appears at the end of the paper. *A list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper.\n\n[e mail: sheila gaynor@regeneron com; aris baras@regeneron com; goncalo abecasis@regeneron com; timothy thornton@regeneron com](mailto:sheila.gaynor@regeneron.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor the past 15 years, genotyping and imputation has been the\n\nworkhorse of genetic association studies[,]. Studies that use array\ngenotyping followed by continually improved imputation are routinely applied to complex traits ranging from macular degeneration to inflammatory bowel disease[,] to schizophrenia and have\nproduced tens of thousands of genetic association signals. IMP\nenables the study of relatively common variants (typically, those\nwith frequencies of >0.1\u20131% that have been characterized in a reference panel of individuals). Recent examples include studies of\nCOVID-19 susceptibility in hundreds of thousands of individuals,\nidentifying genetic variants that lower ACE2 expression as protective\nfactors and identifying variants in IFNAR2 and other immune-related\ngenes as major determinants of susceptibility[,]. Nonetheless,\ntranslating genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings into\nactionable insights for biological understanding and therapeutic\nintervention remains a laborious and ongoing process. Challenges\nin translation arise because most GWAS findings point to non-coding\nvariants, variants whose function is uncertain and/or variants with\nsmall effect sizes.\n\nIn the past 10 years, exome sequencing has emerged as a practi\ncal and successful strategy for uncovering the genetic basis of human\ndisease. WES captures protein-coding variants as rare as singletons\nthat are beyond the reach of arrays and IMP. Exome sequencing\nwas originally used to identify the causes of hundreds of rare Mendelian disorders by studying collections of individual cases and\ntheir families. Exome sequencing studies of complex traits in large\npopulation-based samples are increasingly common. They have\nyielded rare coding variant association signals that are easier to\ninterpret and experimentally follow up than those found in GWAS.\nTranslation for these signals is easier when variants have large effect\nsizes and connect the impaired function of a specific gene to a therapeutic outcome. Recent examples include studies of rare genetic\nvariants that protect against obesity and liver disease[,], pointing to\n_GPR75 and CIDEB, respectively, as potential therapeutic targets. WES_\nand IMP are often used together as an effective approach for capturing both common variants genome-wide and rare protein-altering\nvariants in coding regions.\n\nMost recently, short-read WGS has been applied at scale to dis\nsect Mendelian diseases and common diseases[\u2013]. WGS studies\naim to capture coding and non-coding variation across the allele\nfrequency spectrum and interrogate a much larger collection of\ngenetic variants than either IMP or WES-based approaches. There\nis widespread excitement about the potential of WGS for enabling\ngenetic discovery[,]. WGS has the most substantial resource and time\ncosts, including data generation, processing, storage and analysis, but\nthese are decreasing. At present, it remains unknown whether the\ndeployment of WGS at scale will enable a wave of genetic discoveries\ncomparable to those that resulted from the deployment of arrays,\nIMP and WES.\n\nUnderstanding the relative performance of these approaches is\n\nessential for the design of current and future genetic studies. Here,\nwe systematically assess variants captured and the resulting discovery yield for genetic association studies in large biobank samples\nusing IMP, WES and WGS. For these comparisons, we use data from\n149,195 UK Biobank (UKB) participants who have been characterized\nwith each of these assays and for whom extensive health information\nis available. We first perform a survey of the genetic variants that\ncan be assessed with each approach and then compare the yield of\nsingle-variant and gene-based association signals across a set of 100\ntraits in this large UKB sample. Finally, recognizing that the choice of\nanalysis approach could entail changes in sample size, we evaluate\nassociation yield when varying the sample size using the same set\nof 100 traits. Our study provides an empirical assessment of these\napproaches to facilitate investigators in making informed decisions\nabout large-scale genetic studies\n\n\n### Results\n##### UKB dataset\nOur primary analyses included 149,195 UKB participants with data from\nIMP, WES[,] and WGS as described in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2\nand Supplementary Table 1. Most of the analytical sample was obtained\nfrom individuals of European ancestry (EUR; 95%), with the remaining\nindividuals having African (AFR; 2%), South Asian (SAS; 2%) and other\nancestries (<1%). The UKB used a custom-designed single-nucleotide\npolymorphism (SNP) array with 805,426 variants designed to capture\ncommon variations and selected high-value protein-altering variants.\nWe extended these data to 111,333,957 variants through imputation\nusing TOPMed Freeze 8 genomes as a reference panel, which is an\nancestrally diverse WGS panel comprising genomes of EUR, AFR, Hispanic and Latino (HLA), Asian and other or multiple ancestries (see\nSupplementary Fig. 12 for an evaluation of imputation performance\nby ancestry)[,][,]. WES targeted the coding region of 18,893 genes\n(~1% of the genome) and sequenced 95% of these bases to a depth of\n>25\u00d7 in each individual[,]. WES resulted in 17,131,8674 variants, of\nwhich 10,463,945 were in coding regions. Finally, WGS was carried\nout to a depth of >20\u00d7 using short-read sequencing, ensuring the capture of >95% of the genome with >15\u00d7 depth. Overall, WGS resulted in\n599,385,545 variants. We applied uniform processing and filtering\nto the variant sets from each approach (see Methods for details; key\nfiltering steps included removing variants known to have failed in prior\nlarge-scale WGS efforts). We evaluated four different strategies: IMP,\nWES, WGS and WES + IMP; full results for each strategy are included\nin tables, figures and supplementary information; however, for ease\nof presentation, we focus on the comparison of WES + IMP and WGS,\nwhich were the two approaches with the highest yield of genetic association signals.\n\nOverall, the WGS strategy identified 599,385,545 single-nucleotide\n\nvariants and indels, whereas the WES + IMP strategy identified\n125,694,205 single-nucleotide variants and indels (Fig. 1a,b). Variants\njointly captured by each of the platforms were 99.9% concordant (Supplementary Table 2). In contrast to the total number of variants, the\ncount of variants observed in each individual was similar between the\ntwo approaches, with a mean of 3,595,704 variant alleles per individual\nin WGS and 3,585,289 in WES + IMP (Fig. 1c). The bulk of variants unique\nto WGS are very rare and present in only a few individuals each, explaining how an approximately fivefold increase in overall variant count\ntranslates into only ~0.3% more variant alleles per individual (Fig. 1d).\nFor example, 47% of WGS variants are singleton variants present in\none individual, whereas only 7% of WES + IMP variants are singletons.\n\nVariant identification in coding regions was very similar: the total\n\nnumber of coding variants was 6,732,108 variants for WGS versus\n6,761,880 variants for WES + IMP, and the mean count of coding variant\nalleles per individual was 20,000 for WGS versus 20,039 for WES + IMP\n(Fig. 1c). Within coding regions, 48% of variants were singletons for both\nWGS and WES + IMP. The differential contributions of WES and IMP to\nthe coding and non-coding variant sets in WES + IMP are described in\nFig. 1e. Coding variation is further described in the Supplementary\nNote, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.\n\n##### Single-variant tests\nWe assessed differences in genetic association yield in two stages. First,\nwe evaluated differences in yield for single-variant tests (which are\nresponsible for the bulk of known genetic association signals). Second,\nwe evaluated differences in yield in gene-based tests (discussed in the\nnext section; Supplementary Fig. 4), which can provide more specific\ninsight into the underlying biology. We performed association tests\nacross 80 quantitative and 20 binary traits and first tested each variant present in at least five individuals for association using REGENIE\n(see Methods for further details). We used a significance threshold of\n_P = 5 \u00d7 10[%12] for the main analysis; a threshold of P = 5 \u00d7 10[%11] was used_\nfor classifying a signal as shared across platforms when at least one\n\n\n-----\n\n##### a\n\n\nWES\n\n17,131,874\n\n\n**6,667,929**\n**10,463,945**\n\n\nIMP\n\n111,333,957\n\nWES + IMP\n\n125,694,205\n\n|Col1|6,761,880 118,932,325|\n|---|---|\n\n\nWGS\n\n599,385,545\n\n|Col1|6,732,108 592,653,437|\n|---|---|\n\n\n0 200,000,000 400,000,000 600,000,000\n\nNon\u2013coding Coding\n\n\n##### b\n\nWGS\nConsequence\n\n(% singleton)\n\n\nWES + IMP\n\n(% singleton) Intersection WGS only WES + IMP only % WGS only % WES + IMP only\n\n\nCoding variants 6,732,108 (48%) 6,761,880 (48%) 6,544,263 187,845 217,617 2.7 3.1\n\nNon-coding variants 592,653,437 (47%) 118,932,325 (5%) 111,394,188 481,259,249 7,538,137 80.2 1.3\n\nAll variants 599,385,545 (47%) 125,694,205 (7%) 117,938,451 481,447,094 7,755,754 79.3 1.3\n\n##### c d\n\n3,700,000\n\n\n3,650,000\n\n3,600,000\n\n\n20,400\n\n20,000\n\n\n3,650,000\n\n3,600,000\n\n\n3,000,000\n\n2,000,000\n\n\n3,550,000\n\n3,500,000\n\n\n200,000,000\n\n100,000,000\n\n\n1,000,000\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n19,600\n\n\n3,550,000\n\n3,500,000\n\n\n3,450,000\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nNon\u2013coding AAC\n\n\nNon\u2013coding\n\nWES + IMP WGS\n\n\nAll variants\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nCoding AAC\n\n\nWES + IMP WGS\n\n\n##### e\n\n\nCoding\n\nWES + IMP Non-coding\n\n\nWES + IMP Coding **82.4%** **16.2%** **1.4%**\n\n0% 25% 50% 75% 100%\n\n|oding oding|7.4%|1.4% 91.2%|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||82.4%||16.2% 1.4|%||\n\n\nIMP Both WES and IMP WES\n\n\n**Fig. 1 | Genetic variation captured by genomes, exomes and array**\n**genotyping with imputation.** **a, The number of coding and non-coding**\nvariants for all variants in the WES, IMP, WES + IMP and WGS datasets.\n**b, A comparison of variants observed by the WES + IMP and WGS datasets by**\nfunctional consequence, with the relative gains in approach-exclusive variants.\n**c, The number of variant alleles observed per individual (n = 149,195).**\n\nplatform reached P = 5 \u00d7 10[%12].

We interpret the observation that platform-specific signals are\noften relatively weak, led by rare variants, lack support from nearby\nvariants and failed to replicate as evidence of platform-specific artifacts\nfor many of these signals.\n\nWe also performed the association analysis described above using\n\na less conservative significance threshold of P = 5 \u00d7 10[%10], which resulted\nin more genome-wide significant signals as expected but did not\n\n\nchange the overall conclusions on association yield for the different\napproaches (Supplementary Table 7).\n\n##### Gene-based tests\nIn contemporary genetic association studies, gene-based tests\u2014which\naggregate evidence across rare protein-altering variants in a gene\u2014provide a powerful complement to single-variant tests and are especially\nimportant for identifying biological insights. These tests directly point\nto biological effector mechanisms and can often identify sets of variants with very large effects[,]. Therefore, we followed up our analysis\nof single variants with a series of gene-based tests. We examined coding variants in each gene grouped according to frequency (alternate\nallele frequencies of <1%, <0.1%, <0.01%, <0.001% and singletons) and\nfunctional consequence (missense, deleterious missense and predicted\nloss of function (pLoF)) and considered association tests for which\n\n\n-----\n\nall variants in a gene act in the same or different directions (Methods\nand Supplementary Table 6). We summarized all association tests for\ngene\u2013trait pairs using GENE_P, a single, unified gene-based P value\nin which a significance and replication threshold of P = 2.6 \u00d7 10[%8] was\nused (Methods). We found the overall conclusions from the results\nto be similar when examining the individual gene-based tests using\ndifferent allele frequency thresholds or applying a less conservative\nsignificance threshold (Supplementary Table 7).\n\nWe observed significant associations between 556 gene\u2013trait\n\npairs across the WES + IMP and WGS analysis (Supplementary Data 2).\nWe again found a similar number of signals from WES + IMP (546) and\nfrom WGS (538, a 1% decrease). Consistent with the single-variant\nanalysis, 95% of gene-based association signals (528 out of 556 unique\nsignals) were identified by both WES + IMP and WGS. Again, associations with the largest %log10(P value) were consistently observed\nin WGS and WES + IMP (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). The shared\nsignals included several known true positives, including therapeutically relevant findings such as the PCSK9 association with low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (WGS, P = 1.27 \u00d7 10[%80]; WES, P = 3.91 \u00d7 10[%82]; IMP,\n_P = 1.42 \u00d7 10[%36]; Supplementary Data 2)._\n\nWhen we examined the ten signals exclusive to WGS and the 18 sig\nnals exclusive to WES + IMP, we found that half were signals for which one\napproach exhibited sub-threshold association (2.6 \u00d7 10[%7] < P < 1 \u00d7 10[%5]),\nand the addition of a small number of platform-specific variants\nincreased signals to significance for the alternate approach. The\nremaining cases were driven by a single variant that was platformexclusive (one variant in CALR for WGS, one variant in OMA1 in WES, six\ndifferent variants in IMP). We again sought to replicate these signals in\nthe remaining UKB samples and replicated 14 out of 18 signals exclusive\nto WES + IMP, 5 out of 10 signals exclusive to WGS and 514 out of the 556\nshared signals.\n\n##### The importance of sample size\nAdvancing our understanding of human health and disease requires\nnot only balancing the potential returns from each technology when\napplied to the same samples but also considering the consequences of\nexamining different numbers of samples. To assess the impact of sample\nsize on association study yield, we repeated all analyses on a subset of\n_n = 47,545 individuals in UKB with WGS and WES + IMP and on the entire_\n_n = 468,169 UKB sample with WES + IMP data (Supplementary Figs. 1_\nand 2 and Supplementary Table 1), which correspond to approximately\nthreefold changes in sample size relative to our primary analysis with\n_n = 149,195 individuals._\n\nWhen we focused our analyses on the set of 47,545 individuals\n\n(a threefold decrease in sample size), the number of single-variant\nsignals decreased more than fourfold, from 3,534 to 754 for WGS and\nfrom 3,506 to 738 for WES + IMP, and the number of gene-based signals\ndecreased more than fourfold, from 538 to only 125 for WGS and from\n546 to 124 for WES + IMP. When we extended the WES + IMP analysis\nfrom 149,195 individuals to 468,169 individuals (a threefold increase\nin sample size), the number of single-variant signals increased more\nthan fourfold, from 3,506 to 15,329. Similarly, the number of gene-based\nassociation signals also increased fourfold, from 546 to 2,441. Larger\nsample sizes permitted the identification of additional rare variant\nsignals, often for variants present in the smaller dataset but with insufficient power. Comparing the analyses of 47,545 individuals to the\nanalyses of 468,169 individuals, we find that the approximately tenfold\nincrease in sample size resulted in an approximately 20-fold increase\nin association yield.\n\nChoosing between WGS and WES + IMP had a limited impact on\n\ngenetic association yield (changing the number of signals by about\n1\u20132%) in both the subset sample (n = 47,545) and the main analysis\nsample (n = 149,195). However, increasing the sample size had an outsized increase on overall yield; thus, changes in experimental design\nthatenablelargersamplesthroughlabefficiencies costandanalytical\n\n\nsimplicity can have a much greater impact on discovery yield than\nchoices between these approaches. For example, WES + IMP for all UKB\nsamples has been publicly available since November 2021, whereas the\ncomplete WGS data only became available in November 2023.\n\n##### Signals from each approach alone\nOur analyses thus far have shown that the combination of WES + IMP is\nequivalent to WGS for practical purposes when focused on association\nyield. It can also be important to consider the relative yield from WES\nalone and IMP alone.\n\nFor single-variant association signals, we found IMP and WGS to be\n\nroughly equivalent. Nearly all the variants that could drive a significant\nassociation signal by themselves were common enough to be imputed.\nEven though 90% of peak variants were non-coding (Supplementary\nTable 5), WES alone was able to identify 62% of single-variant association signals. WES was able to find these signals because common variant association signals are enriched near genes and because, through\nlinkage disequilibrium, most single-variant association signals are supported by nearby variants. However, using WES to detect non-coding\nsingle-variant signals resulted in a substantial loss of fidelity, often\nidentifying different peak variants than WGS and IMP (which agreed\n97% of the time).\n\nBroadly speaking, WES and WGS found the same gene-based\n\nassociation results, whereas IMP alone missed 29% of the gene-based\nsignals. In particular, signals driven by very rare variants could not be\nidentified by IMP alone. For example, there were 81 gene\u2013trait pairs\nfor which WGS and/or WES found an association between a burden\nof singleton coding variants (whether pLoF or missense) and a trait at\n_P < 2.6 \u00d7 10[%8]. None of those singleton signals could be found through_\nIMP alone, although 38% could be identified by IMP through burden\ntests that grouped more common variants. In terms of mechanistic\ninsight, these singleton signals are among the most compelling: they\nrefer to loci for which a group of individuals, each with a unique defect\nin the same gene, associates with an altered phenotype. Signals driven\nby rare coding variation also corresponded to some of the largest\neffect association signals. While WGS and WES found quantitative\ntrait signals associated with a change in trait values of >1 standard\ndeviation for 71 and 68 gene\u2013trait pairs, respectively, IMP found only\n15 such signals. For binary traits, there were eight gene-based signals\nassociated with a twofold or more increase or decrease in disease risk\nfor WES and WGS, but only two such signals for IMP. For example,\nin the GCK gene, rare pLoF and deleterious missense variants with a\nfrequency of <0.0001 are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in\nWES (odds ratio, 10.0; P < 10[%20]) and WGS (odds ratio, 10.1; P < 10[%22]) but\nnot in IMP (all P > 0.01)[\u2013].\n\n### Discussion\nGenetic association studies can elucidate human biology as well as support and guide the development of new, life-changing therapies that\nimprove health. Understanding the different strategies for maximizing the yield of these studies, particularly through disease-associated\nsignals with clear mechanistic implications, is critical to enable the\nbest use of limited resources. In this paper, we describe the results\nof a biobank-scale empirical assessment of genetic discovery yield\nfrom WGS, WES and IMP. Using data from 149,195 deeply characterized\nsamples from the UKB, we conducted a head-to-head comparison of\nthese approaches at scale. Although WGS increased the total number of\nassayed variants from 125,694,205 to 599,385,545, the total number of\nassociation signals from WGS differed by only 1% from WES + IMP (from\n3,506 to 3,534 for single variants and 546 to 538 for gene-based tests).\nSome have argued that IMP with a well-matched reference panel may be\nsufficient for genetic association discovery, particularly in population\nisolates. In UKB, we found that sequencing-based approaches enable\ndiscoveries at frequencies below those accessible through IMP, increasinggene-basedfindingsby30%sothatacombinationofWES + IMPwas\n\n\n-----\n\nmost effective for UKB. We found no clear advantage of WGS over the\nstrategy of combining WES and IMP (WES + IMP) for single-variant and\ngene-based association discovery when measured as association yield.\n\nThe limited additional association yield from WGS is probably\n\nbecause most variants specific to WGS are non-coding and very rare.\nDetecting signals with rare non-coding variants requires grouping\nthem with variants of similar function, which presently cannot be done\neffectively and remains a major challenge. Although coding variants\nhave been effectively grouped into aggregated sets to analyze the\nlowest-frequency variants, our ability to classify, group and interpret\nnon-coding variants is not yet advanced enough to similarly analyze the\nrarest non-coding variants. In the future, if such aggregate approaches\ncan successfully group rare non-coding variants, this could provide a\npotential benefit of WGS.\n\nEach of the approaches we evaluated can be used to capture\n\nother types of variants in addition to SNPs and indels. For instance,\nwe analyzed 637,039 structural variants (SVs) (median, 7,952 structural\nvariants per individual) detected in the WGS data, but these structural\nvariants resulted in only 16 additional association signals (3,586 with\nSVs and 3,570 without SVs; Supplementary Table 8) in addition to those\ncaptured from single-nucleotide variants and indels across the 100\ntraits examined. As sequencing approaches evolve beyond the current\nshort-read standards, it may be possible for variants other than SNPs\nand indels to make larger contributions to discovery.\n\nThe IMP component of the WES + IMP approach requires a suitable\n\nWGS reference panel for imputation. There are still many populations\nthat are insufficiently represented in contemporary reference panels,\nand there remains a need for diverse WGS reference datasets to increase\nimputation accuracy and genetic discovery across all ancestries. In our\nIMP analysis with the TOPMed WGS panel, we found that imputation\naccuracy in UKB varied by ancestry, with the highest accuracy for EUR\nand AFR ancestry individuals; by contrast, East Asian (EAS) and SAS\nancestries had the lowest imputation accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 12).\nAlternative panels with improved performance in these ancestries and\nacross the UK have been proposed (Supplementary Fig. 13 and ref. 39).\nWGS studies that enable improved imputation reference panels[,][,][,]\ncan thus enhance genetic association discovery for future studies.\n\nThe cost and complexity of biobank-scale WGS can be substan\ntial compared to WES + IMP, yet our analysis indicated that the two\napproaches have a comparable association yield (1% higher yield for\nsingle variants and 1% lower yield for gene-based tests with WGS). We\nnote that approaches for WGS and WES + IMP continue to evolve. For\ninstance, sequencing labs at the Regeneron Genetics Center use a\ncombined exome and common variant capture assay, eliminating the\nneed for a separate genotyping array. Others have used low-coverage\nWGS in combination with WES and still others continue to develop\nlong-read alternatives to extend the potential of WGS. Optimal use of\nresources must also consider the value of generating genetic data on\nadditional samples versus obtaining deeper phenotypic characterization (perhaps proteomics and RNA sequencing) on the same samples\nas alternatives to broad WGS[\u2013]. Selecting the best strategy for each\nstudy should also take into consideration study design and goals, considering, for instance, the cost of recruitment (which is often relatively\nmodest for biobank studies but very high for studies of rare Mendelian\ndisorders) relative to genome assay and analysis costs. Our results\nshow that increasing sample size is an extremely effective strategy for\nimproving discovery yield. For example, an approximately threefold\nincrease in sample size resulted in an approximately fourfold increase\nin signals, and an approximately tenfold increase in sample size resulted\nin an approximately 20-fold increase in signals. Although we see greater\ndiscovery yield by increasing sample size, we importantly found that\nthe limited difference in yield between WGS and WES + IMP was consistent across sample sizes.\n\nBased on our large-scale analyses of IMP, WES and WGS, we find\n\nthat allocating resources towards characterizing the largest possible\n\n\nsample sizes with WES + IMP should maximize genetic association\ndiscovery yield. Until WGS costs decrease further, it is our view that\nthe greatest opportunity for WGS to further genetic association discovery is by increasing the diversity and availability of imputation\nresources, particularly for non-European ancestry populations. At the\nsame time, we expect that as more targeted samples are sequenced\nwith WGS, the performance of IMP-based approaches will continue to\nincrease and thereby further decrease any potential relative advantage of biobank-scale WGS. Resource-efficient genetic studies supplemented with population-scale functional assays can empower\ndiscovery and facilitate the biological follow-up that is essential for\ntranslating genetic discoveries into benefits for human health.\n\n### Online content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information,\nacknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code avail[ability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01930-4.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01930-4)\n\n### References\n1.

The UKB project has ethical approval reviewed and provided\nby the North West Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent was\nprovided by all study participants.\n\n##### UKB data preparation\nThe sample collection and preparation for the UKB has been previously described for each platform: arrays[,], WES[,] and WGS. These\napproaches are summarized below.\n\n**Array genotyping. For array genotyping, DNA was extracted and**\nprovided in aliquots to Affymetric Research Services Laboratory for\ngenotyping. Blood samples were genotyped using the UKB Axiom\narray with 805,426 variants. The samples were processed in 106 batches\nusing a custom multi-batch genotype calling pipeline. Multiple quality\nchecks including marker-based (evaluating new markers and effects\nbased on factors such as batch, plate, sex and array) and sample-based\n(missing rates and heterozygosity) were performed.\n\n**Exome sequencing. For exome sequencing, DNA was prepared in frag-**\nments of 200 bp on average with 10 bp unique bar codes. Samples were\nprocessed with IDT\u2019s xGen probe library, PCR-amplified and quantified\nby quantitative PCR. Multiplexed samples were sequenced with 75 bp\npaired-end reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with S2 or\nS4 flow cells. The OQFE protocol was applied for reference alignment\nto GRCh38, variants were called using DeepVariant, aggregation was\nperformed using GLnexus to generate a project-level pVCF file using\nan AQ1 cutoff of 20 and quality checks were performed. Using this\napproach, 96% of targeted bases were covered at a depth of >20\u00d7.\n\n**Genome sequencing. A pseudo-random subset of samples was**\nselected for genome sequencing. DNA was prepared in fragments of\n450\u2013500 bp on average with barcode tracking. Samples were processed\nwith IDT for Illumina, purified and pooled. Libraries were prepared\nfrom paired-end reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with\nS4 flow cells. The deCODE pipeline was applied for reference alignment to GRCh38, processing and merging, variant calling using GATK\nHaplotypeCaller and Graphtyper (v.2.7.1), and quality checks were\nperformed. In this approach, samples had an average depth of >23.5\u00d7.\n\n##### Imputation of array datasets using the TOPMed Freeze 8 reference panel\nArrays were imputed using the TOPMed Freeze 8 reference panel on\nthe Michigan Imputation Server. Array variants were selected previously based on UKB imputation use with HRC and ability to liftover\nto GRCh38 and uploaded in randomized batches for imputation on the\nserver. The resulting VCF files were merged and concatenated, then\nsubset to the individuals included in the present analysis. To retain\nhigh-quality imputed genotypes, variants with MAC > 5 and MACH\n_r > 0.3 were retained._\n\n##### Ancestry assignment\nThe continental ancestry of the sampled individuals was assigned\nas previously described. In brief, principal components (PCs) were\ncomputed using the HapMap3 samples as reference, including all SNPs\nshared with the UKB array data, and then each of the UKB samples was\nprojected onto the PCs. A kernel density estimator was trained and used\nto calculate the likelihood of a sample belonging to a continental ancestry group: AFR, HLA, EAS, EUR and SAS. Samples with a likelihood of a\nsingle ancestry greater than 0.3 were assigned that ancestry; samples\nwith a likelihood of two ancestries greater than 0.3 were assigned AFR\noverEUR HLAoverEUR HLAoverEAS SASoverEURandHLAoverAFR\n\n\nIf ancestry likelihoods were all less than 0.3 or three ancestries were\ngreater than 0.3, the sample was excluded from the analysis.\n\n##### Analysis-ready dataset preparation\n**Sample selection. To permit comparison across platforms, we identi-**\nfied all individuals for whom array genotyping, exome sequencing and\ngenome sequencing were available. This yielded a sample of n = 149,195\nand was our primary analytical set. To evaluate the influence of sample size, we also constructed a sample from all individuals with both\narray genotyping and exome sequencing. This yielded a sample of\n_n = 468,169 individuals. We also generated a subset of individuals from_\nour main analysis set by downsampling to retain the same multiplier\n(3.138) between sample sets. We randomly selected n = 47,545 individuals with genome sequencing data for the final sample. Lastly, we\ngenerated a replication sample by selecting all n = 318,974 individuals\nwith WES + IMP that were not included in the primary analytical set of\n_n = 149,195 individuals._\n\n**Genetic data. Data were prepared for analysis within each platform**\nusing consistent filtering. For the sequencing datasets, all variants\nwith MAC \u2265 1 were considered. The WES data were called using an AQ1\ncutoff of 20. Across all genetic datasets, we excluded variants with\nHardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium test P > 1 \u00d7 10[%15] and >10% missingness.\nWe further excluded all variants that failed quality control in TOPMed\nFreeze 8 (ref. 22) or failed quality control as given by the GraphTyper\nHQ definition in a previous publication. Analysis-ready datasets were\ngenerated in Plink2 file sets (PGEN format).\n\n**Phenotype data. For the phenotype data, we used trait data from the**\nUKB Data Showcase. A set of 100 traits (listed in Supplementary Data 3)\nwas selected to permit generalizable conclusions on genetic association discovery yield for quantitative and binary traits. Traits were\nselected from 492 traits that were previously described and identified\nto have rare variant associations. The trait set was reduced to retain 80\nquantitative and 20 binary traits by pruning for redundancy, sufficient\ncase counts and prioritizing trait heritability. Each of the quantitative\ntraits was rank-based inverse-normal transformed before analysis.\n\n##### Gene and variant annotation\nVariants were annotated using VEP based on the canonical transcript of protein-coding transcripts. Gene regions were defined using\nEnsembl release 100, and canonical transcripts were defined using\nMANE tags where available, followed by APPRIS or Ensembl tags\nas necessitated. Variants were defined as pLoF when annotated as\nframeshift, stop gained, splice donor or acceptor, start lost, or stop lost.\nMissense variants were further assigned a deleteriousness score ranging from 0 to 5 based on five algorithms in dbNSPF: SIFT, PolyPhen2\nHDIV and HVAR, LRT and MutationTaster. Deleterious scores were\ngrouped as \u2018likely deleterious\u2019 when predicted deleterious by five out\nof five algorithms, \u2018possibly deleterious\u2019 when predicted deleterious\nby at least one out of five algorithms and \u2018likely benign\u2019 when predicted\ndeleterious by zero out of five algorithms.\n\n##### Association analyses\nAll association analyses were performed using REGENIE (v.3.1.1). For\neach of the 100 traits, we ran Step 1 of REGENIE using the observed\ngenotyping array data. Array variants were included with <10% missingness and Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium test P > 10[%15]. The resulting\npredictors were included as covariates in Step 2 of REGENIE, in addition to age, age squared, sex, age-by-sex and ten ancestry-informative\nPCs derived from the array data. Our association analyses considered\nautosomes and chromosome X.\n\n**Single-variant associations. For single-variant analysis, each variant**\nwith MAC \u22655 was tested using Step 2 of REGENIE separately for each\n\n\n-----\n\nplatform. We considered a significance threshold of P = 5 \u00d7 10[%12] based\non Bonferroni correction for testing 100 phenotypes genome-wide.\nTo identify independent signals, we performed peak-finding jointly\nacross each dataset. This approach merged all sets of results (WGS,\nWES, imputed array) and identified independent peaks by scanning\nacross the genome and identifying significant associations, then selecting the most significant signal and pruning signals to only permit one\nsignificant signal per 1,000 kb. To account for shared signals obscured\nby the significance threshold, we considered signals to be shared when\na variant has a P value within one order of magnitude of the significance\nthreshold (P = 5 \u00d7 10[%11]) in the comparative platform; platform-specific\nunique signals did not have any signals within one order of magnitude\nof significance within 1,000 kb in the comparative platform. At each\nsample size, we excluded outlier significant associations from variants\n(112 associations) with high overall genotype mismatch (genotype discordance of >20%) identified in our main analysis sample from results\nwhen comparison was available across platforms. We evaluated outlier\nvariants and excluded genotype mismatches again when considering a\nless conservative significance threshold as a result of the introduction\nof new signals. Replication was performed using the same approach\nfor the replication sample (in WES, imputed array data), maintaining\nthe significance threshold of P = 5 \u00d7 10[%12].\n\n**Gene-based associations. We performed aggregation tests on rare**\nvariants using Step 2 of REGENIE separately for each platform to identify gene-based associations in coding regions. Annotations were used\nto generate gene sets by collapsing variants within gene regions based\non allele frequency and functional consequence. We considered seven\nconsequence-based masks (Supplementary Table 6): pLoF, pLoF + likely\ndeleterious missense, pLoF + likely or possibly deleterious missense,\npLoF + all missense, likely deleterious missense, likely or possibly\ndeleterious missense, and all missense. We considered five allele frequency bins for each of the consequence-based masks, based on the\nalternative allele frequency thresholds: alternative allele frequency\n(AAF) \u2264 1%, AAF \u2264 0.5%, AAF \u2264 0.1%, AAF \u2264 0.01% and singletons only.\nCollectively, up to 35 mask combinations were tested for each gene\nwhen sufficient data were available for testing. A unified test was performed for each gene to yield a gene-level P value that aggregated each\nmask combination across all testing frameworks (burden, SKAT and\nACAT tests). We considered a significance threshold of P = 2.6 \u00d7 10[%8]\nbased on a Bonferroni correction for all gene-based tests within each\nplatform; signals were defined as shared if the comparative platform\nhad a P value within one order of magnitude of significance (2.6 \u00d7 10[%7]).\nPlatform-specific unique gene-based signals did not have P < 2.6 \u00d7 10[%7]\nin the comparative platform. At each sample size, we excluded significant associations from sets with outlier variants (17 associations)\nwith high heterozygous genotype mismatch (genotype discordance\nof >40%, a relaxed threshold compared to single-variant testing, as\nmultiple variants contribute to gene-based signals) identified in our\nmain analysis sample from results when comparison was available\nacross platforms. We evaluated outlier variants and excluded genotype\nmismatches again when considering a less conservative significance\nthreshold as a result of the introduction of new signals. Replication of\nsignificant associations was performed using the same approach with\nthe replication sample (in WES, IMP data), maintaining the significance\nthreshold of P = 2.6 \u00d7 10[%8].\n\n##### Reporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n### Data availability\nFull details of trait associations with variants and genes are available in Supplementary Data 1 and 2, respectively.

[DOI:10.1038/s41588-024-01930-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01930-4)\n\n#### **TL;DR**\n\nThis study evaluates the effectiveness of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and array genotyping with imputation (IMP) for identifying genetic association signals in the UK Biobank. Results indicate that WES + IMP is a cost-effective alternative to WGS, yielding nearly as many association signals with only a 1% difference in signal yield.\n\n#### **Study Highlights**\n\n1. **Comparison Across Sequencing and Imputation Strategies**: Evaluates 149,195 UK Biobank participants across WGS, WES, and IMP, demonstrating that WGS yields fivefold more variants but only 1% more association signals than WES + IMP.\n  \n2. **Cost-Effectiveness of WES + IMP**: Findings suggest that WES + IMP is nearly as effective as WGS in detecting genetic associations while being more resource-efficient, making it a viable strategy for large-scale genetic studies.\n\n3. **Scalable Signal Yield with Expanded WES + IMP**: Expanding WES + IMP to a larger sample (468,169 individuals) results in a fourfold increase in the number of association signals, underscoring its value in maximizing discoveries.\n\n4. **Application to 100 Complex Traits**: The study focuses on 100 complex traits, providing insights into how WES + IMP can effectively capture genetic associations across diverse phenotypes.\n\n#### **Methodology Summary**\n\n- **Dataset and Trait Analysis**: Analyzes data from 149,195 UK Biobank participants with WGS, WES, and IMP, examining genetic associations across 100 complex traits.\n  \n- **Statistical Framework**: Utilizes REGENIE for both single-variant and gene-based association tests, applying a stringent significance threshold (P = 5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2) to identify reliable genetic associations.\n\n- **Scalability with Large Sample Sizes**: Expands WES + IMP to 468,169 individuals, substantially boosting the detection of association signals, supporting the feasibility of WES + IMP for large-scale studies.\n\n#### **Significance and Applications**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of cost-effective methods for genetic association studies, showing that WES + IMP can achieve results comparable to WGS with significantly fewer resources.

Ritchie, Jingqin Wu, Rodrigo C\u00e1novas, Aoife McMahon, Laura W. Harris, Helen Parkinson & Michael Inouye\n\n\nCheck for updates\n\n\n#### Polygenic scores (PGSs) have transformed human genetic research and have numerous potential clinical applications. Here we present a series of recent enhancements to the PGS Catalog and highlight the PGS Catalog Calculator, an open-source, scalable and portable pipeline for reproducibly calculating PGSs that democratizes equitable PGS applications.\n\nLarge cohorts of individuals for whom detailed phenotypic and genotype information is available have enabled researchers to map the\nassociation of genetic variants across the genome with thousands of\ndiseases and quantitative traits in genome-wide association studies\n(GWAS). This GWAS information \u2014 either as individual-level results\nor in summary statistics \u2014 can be leveraged to estimate an individual\u2019s\ngenetic predisposition for a given phenotype (as a sum of variant dosages multiplied by their effect sizes) and is referred to as a polygenic\nscore (PGS) or polygenic risk score depending on the context and application. Many tools exist to develop PGSs (that is, to select the variants\nand weights included in the score), and pipelines exist to automate\ndevelopment. PGSs have numerous research uses (for example, as\ninstruments to interrogate molecular pathways, or in gene\u2013environment studies) and possible clinical applications (in risk stratification,\npredicting treatment responses and disease subtyping, for instance).\n\n###### Expanded data content and interface improvements\n[The PGS Catalog (https://www.pgscatalog.org) was developed to collect](https://www.pgscatalog.org)\nand distribute information about previously developed PGSs so that\nanalyses can be reproduced and scores can be reused. The catalog is an\nopen and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) database, cataloging the relevant metadata that are required for accurate\napplication and evaluation in a standardized format that is endorsed\nby co-developed reporting standards. This includes information about\nthe samples and methods of PGS development, performance metrics\nthat summarize the predictive ability of the PGS in external samples,\nand a scoring file that can be applied to new samples to calculate the\nPGS. The PGS Catalog is based on data curated from publications, as\nwell as data deposited by authors directly. Metadata and scoring files in\nthePGSCatalogareaccessiblebyawebinterface file-transferprotocol\n\n\n(FTP) or representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface (API) for programmatic access and download. The catalog has been visited by around 27,000 users from over 140 countries\nin the past year alone and serves as a platform for PGS research \u2014 for\nexample, as the source for scores that can be ensembled for improved\npolygenic prediction or for return of PGS results to individuals in a\nclinical trial.\n\nSince the initial publication of the PGS Catalog (in December\n\n2020), the data content has grown substantially and, as of August\n2024, the catalog contains 4,850 PGSs (a 739% increase) comprising\ndata from 656 publications (a 551% increase) (Fig. 1a). Eligible publications are identified systematically using a machine-learning-based\nliterature triage, trained on 1,704 publications that have been screened\nfor eligibility since 2019 (encompassing 896 eligible PGS publications\nfrom 2008 to the present) and retrained yearly. The literature triage\nidentifies roughly 16 papers per week that are eligible for inclusion\n(out of roughly 30 that are screened), and papers are prioritized for\ndata curation if the scoring files are made available and if they include\nancestrally diverse data or new traits. Processes for submissions have\nbeen streamlined, and authors are encouraged to submit directly to the\ncatalog by sending a scoring file and spreadsheet with required meta[data about score development and evaluation (http://www.pgscatalog.](http://www.pgscatalog.org/submit)\n[org/submit). Authors can also choose to embargo data until publica-](http://www.pgscatalog.org/submit)\ntion of the final manuscript in order to add PGS Catalog identifiers to\ntheir text (to comply with journal data-sharing requirements). Data\nfrom preprints also meet publication eligibility, as well as scores with\npublic-domain licenses (Creative Commons, for instance). Within the\npast year, 23% of the released publications were submitted directly by\nauthors, and we continue to work with publishers to ensure that all PGS\npublications make their data accessible at the time of publication. The\nscores in the catalog predict traits that map to 656 unique ontology\nterms (a 421% increase), with many recent traits being less-prevalent\ndiseases (such as hypothyroidism) or quantitative traits (including\nneuroimaging-derived traits).\n\nIt is well documented that PGSs developed using genetic data\n\nfrom participants of predominantly European ancestries have reduced\npredictive performance in populations of non-European ancestries; however, some scores developed using multi-ancestry data\nor more-advanced methods have improved transferability. Thus,\nit is important to understand the ancestral makeup and diversity of\nthe samples used to develop a PGS, in order to assess whether it may\nbe a useful genetic predictor for any new population. Towards this\ngoal we developed a new interface for all PGS tables on the website\n\n\n-----\n\n## Comment\n\n###### a Item: Scores Publications\n\n\n###### c Ancestry: European only Multiple ancestries Asian only African only Additional ancestry only\n\n5,000\n\n4,000\n\n3,000\n\n2,000\n\n1,000\n\n\n5,000\n\n4,000\n\n\n3,000\n\n2,000\n\n\n0\n\n\n1,000\n\n0\n\n\n5,000\n\n4,000\n\n3,000\n\n2,000\n\n1,000\n\n0\n\n\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n\nYear\n\n\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n\nYear\n\n\n###### b\n\n**Fig. 1 | Data growth and improvement of the PGS Catalog.** **a, Cumulative number**\nof PGSs (scores) and publications indexed in the PGS Catalog from inception\n(October 2019) until now (August 2024). b, Example of an ancestry filter present\non every table with multiple PGSs; in the example shown, the filter has been set\nto identify any PGS with African ancestry samples used for development (that is,\n\n\nthat allows users to visualize and filter scores which include a specific\nancestry group or multi-ancestry data at any stage of score development and evaluation (Fig. 1b).

Few tools\ndedicated to PGS calculation have been developed or implemented\nin a workflow manager (such as Nextflow or Snakemake), which limits\ntheir portability and scalability. Also essential to the use of PGSs is\nthe ability to report genetic predisposition on an interpretable scale,\nas many PGSs have distributions that are confounded by ancestry;\nalthough such methods are available[,], no stand-alone software exists\nto adjust PGSs across genetic ancestry groups. A tool combining these\nfeatures would increase the reusability of PGS data and lower the barrier\nto entry for equitable PGS analysis to users without specific training in\nbioinformatics \u2014 an important consideration for facilitating clinical\nstudies. Moreover, given the sensitivity of human genetic data, solutions should allow users to bring 'code to the data' rather than requiring\ndata to be uploaded to web servers, which can cause governance issues.\n\nTo address these gaps, we developed the PGS Catalog Calculator\n\n[(pgsc_calc; https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc) \u2014 a reproduc-](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc)\nible workflow for PGS calculation, ancestry analysis and adjustment of\ncalculated scores. The workflow is optimized to enable users to calculate PGSs at biobank scale across diverse computing environments,\nincluding high-performance compute clusters, airlocked trusted\nresearch environments, and cloud architectures. Users can specify\nany combination of scores from the PGS Catalog for calculation using\nscore, publication, or trait identifiers, or supply their own custom PGS\nscoring files. PGS results are aggregated and output into a results file,\nalong with a summary report.\n\nThe PGS Catalog Calculator is implemented in Nextflow, a popular\n\nworkflow system used by many bioinformaticians. Nextflow orchestrates parallel computational analyses on numerous platforms and job\nschedulers (such as AWS, Google and SLURM) using the most common\nmethods for reproducibly distributing software (such as Docker, Singularity or Conda) and has a community framework for open-source\ndevelopment (nf-core). The calculator code is open source, main[tained by the PGS Catalog team and available on Github (https://github.](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc)\n[com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc), which also hosts documentation (https://](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc)\n[pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/), an active-issues tracker and a discussion](https://pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/)\nforum to offer support and communicate with users.\n\nAn overview of the workflow is shown in Fig. 2a, and the implemen\ntation is described in detail in Supplementary Notes 1 and 2. In brief,\nthe PGS Catalog Calculator takes an input of target genomes in most\nof the commonly used genomics formats (variant call format or PLINK\n1 or 2 format) and genome-build information for PGS calculation. The\ninput file(s) can contain all variants, or be split into one file per chromosome to enable parallelization and faster calculation. Scoring files\nfrom the PGS Catalog are automatically downloaded and combined\nwith any user-supplied scores. PGS variants are matched to variants\nin the target genotypes, automatically handling typical but complex\nscenarios of multi-allelic variants, strand flips and scores with only the\neffect allele with sensible default settings. Final scoring files are created, along with an auditable log summarizing the variants that have\nbeenexcludedandwhy PGSscoringisappliedtogenotypesinparallel\n\n\nand the results are aggregated and output into a simple tabular results\nfile, along with a report that summarizes the scores calculated, their\nmatching, and the PGS distributions (see Supplementary Note 2). The\nresults file containing the calculated PGSs can easily be combined with\nphenotype information for downstream analyses.\n\nA key challenge is that PGSs are often on different scales that can\nnot be easily interpreted and have no natural cut-points to define \u2018high\nrisk\u2019. A common solution is to express genetic predisposition as a relative measure by standardizing the PGS calculation to the sample mean\nand standard deviation; however, this has the issue of being sensitive\nto the set of samples included in the specific run of PGS calculation.\nNotably, PGS distributions can also be confounded by genetic ancestry\n(Fig. 2b) \u2014 that is, differences in PGS means and variances that arise\nfrom differential allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium between\npopulations. These differences do not necessarily correspond to differences in disease risk (for example, changes in disease prevalence)\nor quantitative trait values between the populations; however, genetic\nancestry is important for estimating relative risk. We have implemented\nthe most common methods to adjust PGS using genetic ancestry information within the PGS Catalog Calculator, to facilitate equitable use\nof PGSs across ancestries (Box 1 and Fig. 2c\u2013e). Despite the necessity\nof rescaling PGSs to a more interpretable relative risk scale, these\nadjustment methods had so far not been implemented in a reproducible package or workflow (see Supplementary Note 4 for comparison\nto other tools). We continue to optimize these adjustments within the\nPGS Catalog Calculator, and our open-source software allows for the\naddition of new methods as they are developed.\n\n###### Conclusions and future developments\nAs research and clinical applications of PGSs continue to grow, so\ntoo will the PGS Catalog. This has been particularly evident with the\nlarge growth in PGSs and evaluations from diverse ancestry groups,\nallowing the construction of new features that allow users to browse\nthese data more easily. We will also continue to evaluate how best to\nrepresent ancestral diversity in order to increase genomic equity\nand in accordance with current best practices. In order to make\nPGSs as accessible as possible, we are committed to increasing the\nease of data deposition into the PGS Catalog and are developing an\nautomated deposition portal in collaboration with the GWAS Catalog\n[(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas), our sibling resource, to make it easier](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas)\nfor users to validate and upload data. Furthermore, we will continue\nto develop our documentation and training materials and to deliver\nworkshops, in order to support users and maximize the impact of\nopen sharing of PGSs.\n\nTo democratize secure PGS calculation and ancestry adjustment,\n\nwe developed the PGS Catalog Calculator. This software tool provides\nadvantages to the user \u2014 notably, the implementation of methods to\nensure that PGS distributions are consistent among genetic ancestry\ngroups, which would otherwise be a barrier to the equitable application\nof PGSs. The calculated scores are all forms of relative risk that depend\non the method used and are provided in a simple format to allow users\nto integrate these results into other steps of genetic prediction studies\n(for example, measurements of PGS\u2013trait associations or predictions\nof absolute risks). The calculator has an active user community on\nour Github and has been successfully deployed to many computing\nenvironments (including university and cloud high-performance\ncompute clusters, and airlocked trusted research environments)\nand integrated into online web server/platforms. Future versions\nwill further improve ancestry estimation and normalization and will\n\n\n-----\n\n## Comment\n\n###### a\n\n\n###### b\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nMost similar population\n\nAFR AMR CSA EAS EUR\n\n\u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1\n\n\n###### e\n\n\n###### c\n\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n\n###### d\n\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\n0.0\n\n\u22124 0 4\n\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.0\n\n\nSUM\n\n\u22124 0 4\n\n\n\u22124 0 4\n\n\n_Z_MostSimilarPop_\n\n**Fig. 2 | The PGS Catalog Calculator for reproducible PGS calculation, with**\n**estimation and adjustment for genetic ancestry.** **a, Visual summary of the PGS**\nCatalog Calculator (pgsc_calc) pipeline, displaying the inputs, outputs and\ndata flows between modules. b\u2013e, To illustrate the usefulness of the pipeline,\nwe calculated PGS000018 (PGS identifier; PGS name. metaGRSCAD; 1,745,179\nvariants) for all approximately 487,000 individuals with imputed genotypes\nin the UK Biobank using pgsc_calc, and ran the ancestry adjustments using\nHGDP+1kGP as a reference panel (Box 1 and Supplementary Note 2). b, PGSs\ncalculated as a weighted SUM of dosages have different distributions in different\nancestry groups (grouped on the basis of their \u2018most similar population\u2019 label\n\n\n_Z_norm1_\n\n\n_Z_norm2_\n\n\nimplement newer methods for PGS calculation as they are developed.\nThe current PGS Catalog Calculator is optimized to calculate PGSs\non imputed genotypes derived from genotyping array data; however, a common user request is to support whole-genome sequencing\ndata (unimputed variant call formats) In the future tools to support\n\n\nfrom the reference panel: African (AFR), American (AMR), Central and South\nAsian (CSA), East Asian (EAS) and European (EUR) superpopulation ancestry).\n**c\u2013e, Ancestry adjustment methods applied to UK Biobank data make PGS**\ndistributions more comparable across populations in terms of their mean and\nvariance (see Box 1 for further details).

To\nvisualize PGS distributions and adjust PGSs using ancestry similarity\nand projections, the PGS Catalog Calculator uses the largest open\ndata set of globally representative genotyped individuals from\nthe Human Genome Diversity Panel and 1000 Genomes Project\n(HGDP+1kGP) as default; however, custom panels can also be used.\n\nMethods for ancestry adjustment of a PGS start by determining\n\nthe overlap of reference panel and target variants, then creating a\nPCA of the reference panel and projecting target individual(s) into\nthe genetic ancestry space using methods that avoid issues of PCA\nshrinkage. The PCA projections are used to determine the population\nin the reference panel to which the individual is most similar. The\npopulation labels in the reference panel are not comprehensive or\ndeterministic; so, samples from the target data set are described only\nin terms of their genetic similarity to these populations. This avoids\ntransfer of ancestry labels that may not reflect the new individuals.\nThe relative PGS for each individual can then be calculated by\ncomparing the calculated PGS to the distribution of the PGS in the\nmost similar population in the reference panel and reporting it as a\npercentile or Z-score (Z_MostSimilarPop; Fig. 2c).\n\nWhen treating ancestry as a continuum (represented by an\n\nindividual\u2019s projection into PCA space), or when an individual\n\n**Reporting summary.
